A Spring Boot service that manages Organization entities with full CRUD operations, soft deletion, and default organization handling for multi-tenant applications.

## Key Components

- **DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_NAME**: Constant for the default organization name ("Default")
- **getOrganizationById()**: Retrieves organization by document ID, excluding soft-deleted records
- **getOrganizationByOrganizationId()**: Finds organization by unique organization identifier
- **getOrganizationByName()**: Searches organizations by name
- **getDefaultOrganization()**: Retrieves the default organization for the tenant
- **createOrganization()**: Creates new organization entities
- **updateOrganization()**: Updates existing organizations
- **deleteOrganization()**: Performs soft deletion with machine dependency validation
- **createDefaultOrganization()**: Creates the default organization for new tenants

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private OrganizationService organizationService;

// Create a new organization
Organization org = Organization.builder()
    .name("Engineering Team")
    .organizationId("eng-001")
    .category("Development")
    .build();
Organization created = organizationService.createOrganization(org);

// Find organization by ID
Optional<Organization> found = organizationService.getOrganizationById(created.getId());

// Create default organization for new tenant
organizationService.createDefaultOrganization();

// Soft delete (validates no associated machines)
try {
    organizationService.deleteOrganization(org.getId());
} catch (OrganizationHasMachinesException e) {
    // Handle case where machines are still associated
}
```

The service includes comprehensive validation, ensuring default organizations cannot be deleted and organizations with associated machines cannot be removed, maintaining data integrity across the system.
