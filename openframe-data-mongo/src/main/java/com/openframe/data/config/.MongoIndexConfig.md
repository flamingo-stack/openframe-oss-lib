Spring Configuration class that automatically creates MongoDB indexes for the application_events collection during application startup to optimize query performance.

## Key Components

- **MongoIndexConfig** - Configuration class annotated with `@Configuration` for Spring auto-detection
- **mongoTemplate** - Injected MongoTemplate for database operations
- **initIndexes()** - Method executed after bean construction to create compound indexes

## Usage Example

This configuration automatically runs when the Spring application starts. The indexes are created on the `application_events` collection:

```java
// Index 1: Compound index for user-specific event queries
// Optimizes queries like: find events by userId, sorted by timestamp DESC
db.application_events.find({"userId": "user123"}).sort({"timestamp": -1})

// Index 2: Compound index for event type and tag filtering  
// Optimizes queries like: find events by type and metadata tags
db.application_events.find({
    "type": "USER_ACTION", 
    "metadata.tags": {$in: ["analytics", "tracking"]}
})
```

The `@PostConstruct` annotation ensures indexes are created automatically after the MongoTemplate is injected, eliminating the need for manual database setup. The `ensureIndex()` method safely creates indexes only if they don't already exist.
