A data transfer object that defines filtering criteria for querying events in the OpenFrame document system. This filter supports multi-dimensional filtering by user IDs, event types, and date ranges.

## Key Components

- **userIds** - List of user identifiers to filter events by specific users
- **eventTypes** - List of event type strings to filter by event categories
- **startDate** - LocalDate for filtering events from a specific start date (inclusive)
- **endDate** - LocalDate for filtering events up to a specific end date (inclusive)

## Usage Example

```java
// Filter events for specific users and date range
EventQueryFilter filter = EventQueryFilter.builder()
    .userIds(List.of("user123", "user456"))
    .eventTypes(List.of("LOGIN", "DOCUMENT_VIEW"))
    .startDate(LocalDate.of(2024, 1, 1))
    .endDate(LocalDate.of(2024, 12, 31))
    .build();

// Filter for all events of specific types (no user/date restrictions)
EventQueryFilter typeFilter = EventQueryFilter.builder()
    .eventTypes(List.of("CREATE", "UPDATE", "DELETE"))
    .build();

// Filter for recent events from a single user
EventQueryFilter userFilter = EventQueryFilter.builder()
    .userIds(List.of("admin"))
    .startDate(LocalDate.now().minusDays(7))
    .build();
```

The builder pattern with Lombok annotations provides flexible filter construction, allowing any combination of criteria to be specified or omitted for broad or targeted event queries.
