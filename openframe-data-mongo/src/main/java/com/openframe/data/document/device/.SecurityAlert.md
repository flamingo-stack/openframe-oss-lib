A data model class representing security alerts within the OpenFrame device monitoring system, used to track and manage security incidents with resolution tracking capabilities.

## Key Components

- **id**: Unique identifier for the security alert
- **severity**: Alert severity level (e.g., "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW")
- **description**: Human-readable description of the security incident
- **detectedAt**: Timestamp when the security alert was first detected
- **resolved**: Boolean flag indicating if the alert has been addressed
- **resolvedAt**: Timestamp when the alert was marked as resolved
- **resolution**: Description of how the security alert was resolved

## Usage Example

```java
// Create a new security alert
SecurityAlert alert = new SecurityAlert();
alert.setId("SEC-2024-001");
alert.setSeverity("HIGH");
alert.setDescription("Unauthorized access attempt detected");
alert.setDetectedAt(Instant.now());
alert.setResolved(false);

// Later, when resolving the alert
alert.setResolved(true);
alert.setResolvedAt(Instant.now());
alert.setResolution("User credentials reset and access logs reviewed");

// Check alert status
if (alert.isResolved()) {
    System.out.println("Alert " + alert.getId() + " resolved at " + alert.getResolvedAt());
}
```

The class uses Lombok's `@Data` annotation to automatically generate getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods, making it suitable for use in collections, databases, and API responses for security monitoring dashboards.
