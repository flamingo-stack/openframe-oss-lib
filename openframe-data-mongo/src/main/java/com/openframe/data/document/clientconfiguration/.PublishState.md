<!-- source-hash: d1bc701b20706291b011172e584c7e7d -->
A data model that tracks the publication status of client configuration documents, including publication state, timestamp, and retry attempt counts.

## Key Components

- **published** - Boolean flag indicating if the document is currently published
- **publishedAt** - Timestamp of when the document was last published (or attempted)
- **attempts** - Counter for the number of publication attempts made
- **nonPublished()** - Static factory method to create an unpublished state with incremented attempts
- **published()** - Static factory method to create a published state with current timestamp

## Usage Example

```java
// Create initial unpublished state
PublishState initialState = new PublishState(false, null, 0);

// Mark as failed attempt (increments attempts counter)
PublishState failedAttempt = PublishState.nonPublished(initialState);
// Result: published=false, publishedAt=null, attempts=1

// Mark as successfully published
PublishState successState = PublishState.published(failedAttempt);
// Result: published=true, publishedAt=<current time>, attempts=1

// Reset from published state
PublishState resetState = PublishState.nonPublished(successState);
// Result: published=false, publishedAt=null, attempts=0
```

The class uses Lombok annotations for automatic generation of getters, setters, constructors, and builder pattern. It's designed to handle publication retry logic by tracking attempts and maintaining state transitions between published and unpublished states.
