Enumeration that defines the possible compliance states for devices within the OpenFrame system, used to track and categorize device adherence to security and policy requirements.

## Key Components

- **COMPLIANT** - Device meets all required security and policy standards
- **NON_COMPLIANT** - Device fails to meet one or more compliance requirements
- **IN_REMEDIATION** - Device is currently being updated or fixed to achieve compliance
- **UNKNOWN** - Compliance status cannot be determined or has not been evaluated

## Usage Example

```java
// Setting device compliance state
ComplianceState deviceState = ComplianceState.NON_COMPLIANT;

// Checking compliance status
if (deviceState == ComplianceState.COMPLIANT) {
    // Allow device access
    grantAccess();
} else if (deviceState == ComplianceState.IN_REMEDIATION) {
    // Limited access during remediation
    grantLimitedAccess();
} else {
    // Block access for non-compliant or unknown devices
    denyAccess();
}

// Switch-based handling
switch (deviceState) {
    case COMPLIANT:
        enableFullFeatures();
        break;
    case NON_COMPLIANT:
        enforceSecurityPolicies();
        break;
    case IN_REMEDIATION:
        monitorProgress();
        break;
    case UNKNOWN:
        initiateComplianceCheck();
        break;
}
```
