Enumeration defining the possible compliance states for device compliance tracking and management within the OpenFrame system.

## Key Components

- **COMPLIANT** - Device meets all compliance requirements
- **NON_COMPLIANT** - Device fails to meet one or more compliance requirements  
- **IN_REMEDIATION** - Device is currently undergoing remediation to address compliance issues
- **UNKNOWN** - Device compliance status cannot be determined

## Usage Example

```java
import com.openframe.data.document.device.ComplianceState;

public class DeviceManager {
    public void updateDeviceCompliance(Device device, ComplianceState state) {
        device.setComplianceState(state);
        
        switch (state) {
            case COMPLIANT:
                logger.info("Device {} is compliant", device.getId());
                break;
            case NON_COMPLIANT:
                alertingService.sendAlert("Device compliance violation", device);
                break;
            case IN_REMEDIATION:
                scheduleComplianceCheck(device);
                break;
            case UNKNOWN:
                requestComplianceAssessment(device);
                break;
        }
    }
}
