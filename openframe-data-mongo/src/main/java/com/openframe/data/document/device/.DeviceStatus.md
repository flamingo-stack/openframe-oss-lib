This enum defines the possible status states for devices within the OpenFrame system, providing a standardized way to track device lifecycle and operational states.

## Key Components

- **ACTIVE**: Device is operational and in use
- **PENDING**: Device is awaiting activation or configuration
- **INACTIVE**: Device is not currently in use but available
- **MAINTENANCE**: Device is undergoing maintenance or repairs
- **DECOMMISSIONED**: Device has been permanently removed from service
- **ONLINE**: Device is currently connected and responding
- **OFFLINE**: Device is not currently connected
- **DELETED**: Device record has been marked for deletion
- **ARCHIVED**: Device record has been moved to archive storage

## Usage Example

```java
import com.openframe.data.document.device.DeviceStatus;

public class DeviceManager {
    public void updateDeviceStatus(String deviceId, DeviceStatus status) {
        switch (status) {
            case ONLINE:
                enableDeviceServices(deviceId);
                break;
            case MAINTENANCE:
                disableDeviceServices(deviceId);
                scheduleMaintenanceAlert(deviceId);
                break;
            case DECOMMISSIONED:
                removeDeviceFromInventory(deviceId);
                break;
            default:
                logStatusChange(deviceId, status);
        }
    }
    
    public boolean isDeviceOperational(DeviceStatus status) {
        return status == DeviceStatus.ACTIVE || status == DeviceStatus.ONLINE;
    }
}
```
