<!-- source-hash: 0a0d88341b57eb071ed80d5f10d3eed9 -->
An enumeration that defines the possible operational states and lifecycle stages of devices within the OpenFrame system.

## Key Components

- **ACTIVE** - Device is operational and available for use
- **PENDING** - Device is awaiting activation or setup
- **INACTIVE** - Device is temporarily disabled or not in use
- **MAINTENANCE** - Device is undergoing maintenance or repair
- **DECOMMISSIONED** - Device has been permanently removed from service
- **ONLINE** - Device is currently connected and communicating
- **OFFLINE** - Device is disconnected or unreachable
- **DELETED** - Device record has been marked for deletion
- **ARCHIVED** - Device record has been archived for historical purposes

## Usage Example

```java
import com.openframe.data.document.device.DeviceStatus;

public class DeviceManager {
    public void updateDeviceStatus(Device device, DeviceStatus status) {
        device.setStatus(status);
        
        switch (status) {
            case ONLINE:
                enableDeviceOperations(device);
                break;
            case MAINTENANCE:
                scheduleMaintenanceWindow(device);
                break;
            case DECOMMISSIONED:
                archiveDeviceData(device);
                break;
        }
    }
    
    public boolean isDeviceOperational(DeviceStatus status) {
        return status == DeviceStatus.ACTIVE || status == DeviceStatus.ONLINE;
    }
}
```

The enum supports both operational states (ONLINE/OFFLINE) and lifecycle management (ACTIVE/INACTIVE/DECOMMISSIONED), allowing comprehensive device state tracking throughout the system.
