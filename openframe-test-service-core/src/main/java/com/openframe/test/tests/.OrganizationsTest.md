<!-- source-hash: f078423c84452136119df708194a7dff -->
Comprehensive JUnit 5 test class that validates all organization management operations through the OpenFrame API, ensuring CRUD operations work correctly and deleted organizations are properly handled.

## Key Components

- **testCreateOrganization()**: Creates and validates a new organization with all required fields
- **testRetrieveOrganization()**: Retrieves an organization by ID and compares with database record
- **testUpdateOrganization()**: Updates an existing organization and validates changes
- **testDeleteOrganization()**: Soft deletes an organization and verifies deletion flags
- **testRetrieveAllOrganizations()**: Tests that only active organizations are returned in list operations
- **@TestMethodOrder**: Ensures tests run in dependency order (1-5)
- **AuthorizedTest**: Extends base class for authenticated API testing
- **@Tag annotations**: Categorizes tests for OSS testing and monitoring

## Usage Example

```java
// Run all organization tests
@Test
public void runOrganizationTests() {
    // Tests execute in order:
    // 1. Create organization with generated data
    CreateOrganizationRequest request = OrganizationGenerator.createOrganizationRequest(true);
    Organization org = OrganizationApi.createOrganization(request);
    
    // 2. Retrieve and validate against database
    Organization retrieved = OrganizationApi.retrieveOrganization(org.getId());
    assertThat(retrieved).isEqualTo(org);
    
    // 3. Update organization with new data
    Organization updated = OrganizationApi.updateOrganization(org.getId(), updateRequest);
    
    // 4. Soft delete organization
    OrganizationApi.deleteOrganization(org);
    
    // 5. Verify deleted orgs don't appear in active list
    List<String> activeIds = OrganizationApi.getOrganizationIds();
}
```

The test class validates that organization CRUD operations maintain data integrity, proper timestamps, and soft deletion behavior across the OpenFrame platform.
