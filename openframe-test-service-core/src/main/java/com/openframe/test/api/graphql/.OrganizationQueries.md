<!-- source-hash: af912bf0976a2820ef45469519a7f11b -->
A utility class containing GraphQL query strings for retrieving organization data in various formats and detail levels.

## Key Components

- **ORGANIZATION_NAMES** - GraphQL query to fetch organization names using edges/node pagination
- **ORGANIZATION_IDS** - GraphQL query to retrieve organization IDs using edges/node pagination  
- **FULL_ORGANIZATION** - Parameterized GraphQL query to fetch complete organization details including contact information, addresses, and metadata

## Usage Example

```java
// Execute query for organization names
String namesQuery = OrganizationQueries.ORGANIZATION_NAMES;
GraphQLResponse response = graphQLClient.execute(namesQuery);

// Execute query for specific organization details
String fullQuery = OrganizationQueries.FULL_ORGANIZATION;
Map<String, Object> variables = Map.of("id", "org-123");
GraphQLResponse orgDetails = graphQLClient.execute(fullQuery, variables);

// Use in test scenarios
@Test
public void testOrganizationRetrieval() {
    String query = OrganizationQueries.ORGANIZATION_IDS;
    // Test GraphQL endpoint with predefined query
    assertThat(executeQuery(query)).isNotEmpty();
}
```

The queries support OpenFrame's organization management system, providing different levels of detail from basic identification to complete organization profiles with contact information, addresses, revenue data, and contract details.
