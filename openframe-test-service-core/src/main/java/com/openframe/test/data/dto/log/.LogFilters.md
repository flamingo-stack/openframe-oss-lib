<!-- source-hash: 5f238d1fe79190cb2bfefc444407c9a9 -->
A Data Transfer Object (DTO) that represents filtering criteria for log queries, allowing users to filter logs by various attributes like tool types, event types, severities, and organizations.

## Key Components

- **toolTypes** - List of tool type strings to filter logs by specific tools
- **eventTypes** - List of event type strings to filter by specific log event categories
- **severities** - List of severity level strings (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG)
- **organizations** - List of `OrganizationFilterOption` objects for organization-based filtering

## Usage Example

```java
// Create filter criteria for error logs from specific tools
LogFilters filters = LogFilters.builder()
    .toolTypes(List.of("docker", "kubernetes"))
    .eventTypes(List.of("deployment", "restart"))
    .severities(List.of("ERROR", "WARN"))
    .organizations(List.of(
        new OrganizationFilterOption("org-1", "Production"),
        new OrganizationFilterOption("org-2", "Staging")
    ))
    .build();

// Use in log service query
List<LogEntry> filteredLogs = logService.findLogs(filters);
```

The class uses Lombok annotations to automatically generate getters, setters, constructors, and builder pattern methods, making it easy to construct filter objects for log query operations in the OpenFrame test data system.
