<!-- source-hash: 805dbb7f0b0509e97b25ac6846f8c8cb -->
An enumeration that defines the various states a device can be in throughout its lifecycle within the OpenFrame system.

## Key Components

- **PENDING** - Device is awaiting activation or configuration
- **ACTIVE** - Device is operational and available for use
- **INACTIVE** - Device is temporarily disabled but not deleted
- **MAINTENANCE** - Device is undergoing maintenance or repairs
- **DECOMMISSIONED** - Device is permanently removed from service
- **ONLINE** - Device is currently connected and responsive
- **OFFLINE** - Device is not currently reachable
- **DELETED** - Device record is marked for deletion
- **ARCHIVED** - Device is stored for historical purposes

## Usage Example

```java
// Setting device status in a service
public class DeviceService {
    public void updateDeviceStatus(Device device, DeviceStatus status) {
        device.setStatus(status);
        // Save to database
    }
    
    public boolean isDeviceOperational(Device device) {
        return device.getStatus() == DeviceStatus.ACTIVE && 
               device.getStatus() != DeviceStatus.OFFLINE;
    }
    
    public List<Device> getMaintenanceDevices() {
        return deviceRepository.findByStatus(DeviceStatus.MAINTENANCE);
    }
}
```

This enum provides a comprehensive set of states that allows the system to track devices from initial setup through end-of-life, supporting both operational states (online/offline) and lifecycle management (pending, active, decommissioned).
