A simple enumeration representing the connection state of a device in the OpenFrame testing system.

## Key Components

**ConnectionStatus Enum**
- `CONNECTED` - Device is successfully connected and operational
- `DISCONNECTED` - Device is not connected or offline  
- `ERROR` - Device connection is in an error state

## Usage Example

```java
import com.openframe.test.data.dto.device.ConnectionStatus;

public class DeviceMonitor {
    
    public void checkDeviceStatus(Device device) {
        ConnectionStatus status = device.getConnectionStatus();
        
        switch (status) {
            case CONNECTED:
                logger.info("Device {} is online and ready", device.getId());
                break;
            case DISCONNECTED:
                logger.warn("Device {} is offline", device.getId());
                triggerReconnection(device);
                break;
            case ERROR:
                logger.error("Device {} has connection errors", device.getId());
                handleConnectionError(device);
                break;
        }
    }
    
    public boolean isDeviceAvailable(ConnectionStatus status) {
        return status == ConnectionStatus.CONNECTED;
    }
}
```

This enum is typically used in device DTOs and monitoring systems to track and respond to device connectivity states throughout the OpenFrame platform.
