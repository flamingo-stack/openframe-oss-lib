MongoDB collection utility class that provides database access methods for Organization entities in the OpenFrame test framework.

## Key Components

- **`findOrganization(String id)`** - Retrieves a single organization by its ObjectId
- **`findOrganization(boolean deleted, boolean isDefault)`** - Finds organization based on deletion status and default flag
- **`findOrganizationIds(boolean deleted)`** - Returns a list of organization IDs filtered by deletion status

## Usage Example

```java
import com.openframe.test.data.db.collections.OrganizationsCollection;
import com.openframe.test.data.dto.organization.Organization;

// Find organization by ID
Organization org = OrganizationsCollection.findOrganization("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011");

// Find default non-deleted organization
Organization defaultOrg = OrganizationsCollection.findOrganization(false, true);

// Get all active organization IDs
List<String> activeOrgIds = OrganizationsCollection.findOrganizationIds(false);

// Get all deleted organization IDs
List<String> deletedOrgIds = OrganizationsCollection.findOrganizationIds(true);
```

This utility class abstracts MongoDB queries for organizations, providing type-safe access to the "organizations" collection through static methods. It uses MongoDB Java driver filters for efficient querying and supports common organization lookup patterns needed in the test framework.
