A data transfer object (DTO) representing user credentials and domain information for authentication and user management operations within the OpenFrame test suite.

## Key Components

- **User Class**: Main DTO class with Jackson JSON serialization support
- **Core Fields**:
  - `email` - User's email address identifier
  - `password` - User authentication credential
  - `domain` - Associated domain or tenant context
- **Lombok Annotations**: Automatic generation of constructors, getters, setters, and builder pattern
- **JSON Configuration**: Ignores unknown properties during deserialization for API flexibility

## Usage Example

```java
// Creating a user with builder pattern
User user = User.builder()
    .email("admin@company.com")
    .password("securePassword123")
    .domain("company.openframe.ai")
    .build();

// Creating user with constructor
User user = new User("user@test.com", "password", "test-domain");

// JSON serialization/deserialization (automatic with Jackson)
// Incoming JSON with extra fields will be ignored due to @JsonIgnoreProperties
```

This DTO serves as a simple data container for user-related operations in the OpenFrame testing framework, providing clean separation between data representation and business logic while supporting flexible JSON handling for API interactions.
