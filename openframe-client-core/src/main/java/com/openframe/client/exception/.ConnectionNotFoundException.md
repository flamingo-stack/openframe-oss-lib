A runtime exception thrown when an expected connection cannot be found or established within the OpenFrame client framework.

## Key Components

- **ConnectionNotFoundException**: A custom runtime exception that extends `RuntimeException`
- **Constructor**: Accepts a descriptive error message to provide context about the missing connection

## Usage Example

```java
// Throwing the exception when a connection is not found
public Connection getConnection(String connectionId) {
    Connection conn = connectionPool.find(connectionId);
    if (conn == null) {
        throw new ConnectionNotFoundException(
            "Connection with ID '" + connectionId + "' not found in pool"
        );
    }
    return conn;
}

// Catching and handling the exception
try {
    Connection conn = connectionManager.getConnection("db-primary");
    // Use connection...
} catch (ConnectionNotFoundException e) {
    logger.error("Failed to establish connection: " + e.getMessage());
    // Fallback logic or retry mechanism
}
```

This exception is typically used in connection management scenarios where a required database connection, network connection, or other communication channel cannot be located or accessed. Since it extends `RuntimeException`, it's an unchecked exception that doesn't require explicit handling but can be caught when appropriate error recovery is needed.
