Data model representing the results of osquery executions in Fleet MDM, containing query metadata, result rows, and status information.

## Key Components

**Main Properties:**
- `hostId` - Identifier of the host where the query was executed
- `rows` - List of result rows as key-value maps containing query data
- `error` - Error message if query execution failed
- `status` - Execution status of the query
- `query` - The original osquery SQL statement that was executed
- `executedAt` - Timestamp when the query was executed

**Helper Methods:**
- `isSuccess()` - Returns true if the query executed without errors
- `getRowCount()` - Returns the number of rows in the result set

## Usage Example

```java
// Process query results from Fleet MDM
QueryResult result = fleetMdmClient.executeQuery(hostId, "SELECT * FROM processes");

if (result.isSuccess()) {
    System.out.println("Query executed on host: " + result.getHostId());
    System.out.println("Found " + result.getRowCount() + " processes");
    
    // Process each result row
    for (Map<String, Object> row : result.getRows()) {
        String processName = (String) row.get("name");
        Integer pid = (Integer) row.get("pid");
        System.out.println("Process: " + processName + " (PID: " + pid + ")");
    }
} else {
    System.err.println("Query failed: " + result.getError());
}
```

The class uses Jackson annotations for JSON serialization and includes `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` to handle API response variations gracefully.
