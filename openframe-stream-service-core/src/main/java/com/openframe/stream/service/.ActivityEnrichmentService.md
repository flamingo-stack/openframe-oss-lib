This service processes and enriches fleet activity data using Kafka Streams, joining activity messages with host information and adding metadata headers.

## Key Components

- **buildActivityEnrichmentStream()** - Main stream processing method that creates Kafka streams topology
- **enrichActivityWithHostInfo()** - Enriches activity messages by adding host ID information from host activity data
- **HeaderAdderFixedKey** - Inner processor class that adds message type headers to enriched activities
- **JOIN_WINDOW_DURATION** - 5-second window for joining activity and host activity streams

## Usage Example

```java
@Service
public class FleetDataProcessor {
    
    @Autowired
    private ActivityEnrichmentService enrichmentService;
    
    // The service automatically processes streams when Spring Boot starts
    // Input: Activities from fleet-mdm-activities topic
    // Host data from fleet-mdm-host-activities topic  
    // Output: Enriched activities to fleet-mdm-events topic
    
    // Enriched ActivityMessage will contain:
    // - Original activity data
    // - hostId from matching HostActivity
    // - agentId set to hostId value
    // - MESSAGE_TYPE_HEADER with FLEET_MDM_EVENT
}
```

The service automatically joins activity streams with host activity streams within a 5-second window, enriches the data with host information, adds required headers, and forwards to the output topic for downstream processing.
