A Kafka Streams service that enriches fleet activity messages by joining them with host activity data and adding message headers before publishing to an output topic.

## Key Components

- **buildActivityEnrichmentStream()** - Main stream processing pipeline that joins activity and host activity streams
- **enrichActivityWithHostInfo()** - Enrichment logic that adds hostId and agentId to activity messages
- **HeaderAdderFixedKey** - Inner processor class that adds required headers to enriched messages
- **JOIN_WINDOW_DURATION** - 5-second time window for stream joins

## Usage Example

```java
@Configuration
public class StreamsConfig {
    
    @Autowired
    private ActivityEnrichmentService enrichmentService;
    
    @Bean
    public KafkaStreams activityStreams(StreamsBuilder builder) {
        // The service automatically registers its stream topology
        enrichmentService.buildActivityEnrichmentStream(builder);
        return new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), streamsProperties);
    }
}
```

The service processes two input streams:
1. **Activities** - Fleet activity messages keyed by activity ID
2. **Host Activities** - Host-to-activity mappings that provide hostId information

The enrichment adds hostId and agentId fields to activity messages, then publishes them to the enriched events topic with appropriate headers for downstream processing. Failed joins (no matching host activity) still forward the original activity message.
