A Kafka Streams service that enriches fleet activity messages with host information by joining activity streams with host-activity streams and adding message headers.

## Key Components

- **buildActivityEnrichmentStream()** - Main stream processing pipeline that creates KStreams from input topics and performs left join enrichment
- **enrichActivityWithHostInfo()** - Join function that adds host ID and agent ID to activity messages when host data is available
- **HeaderAdderFixedKey** - Inner processor class that adds message type headers to enriched activities
- **Stream Configuration** - Configurable Kafka topic names and join window duration (5 seconds)

## Usage Example

```java
@Configuration
public class StreamsConfig {
    
    @Autowired
    private ActivityEnrichmentService enrichmentService;
    
    // The service automatically creates the enrichment stream when Spring Boot starts
    // Input: fleet-mdm-activities and fleet-mdm-host-activities topics
    // Output: fleet-mdm-events topic with enriched activities
}

// Example enriched activity flow:
// 1. Activity message arrives on activities topic
// 2. Host activity message arrives on host-activities topic  
// 3. Messages are joined by activity ID within 5-second window
// 4. Activity gets enriched with hostId and agentId fields
// 5. Headers added (MESSAGE_TYPE_HEADER, __TypeId__)
// 6. Enriched message sent to events topic
```

The service uses Spring Kafka Streams configuration and automatically processes messages when the application starts, requiring no manual initialization.
