A simple data model class that represents the relationship between a host and an activity in the fleet streaming system, using Jackson annotations for JSON serialization.

## Key Components

- **HostActivity** - Main data class with Lombok `@Data` annotation for automatic getters/setters/equals/hashCode/toString
- **hostId** - Integer field representing the host identifier, mapped to `host_id` in JSON
- **activityId** - Integer field representing the activity identifier, mapped to `activity_id` in JSON

## Usage Example

```java
// Create a new host activity relationship
HostActivity hostActivity = new HostActivity();
hostActivity.setHostId(12345);
hostActivity.setActivityId(67890);

// Or use constructor if available through Lombok
HostActivity relationship = new HostActivity();

// JSON serialization will use the @JsonProperty mappings
// {
//   "host_id": 12345,
//   "activity_id": 67890
// }

// Access fields using generated getters
Integer host = hostActivity.getHostId();
Integer activity = hostActivity.getActivityId();
```

This class serves as a lightweight data transfer object for linking hosts to their associated activities in the fleet management system, with automatic JSON field mapping for API integration.
