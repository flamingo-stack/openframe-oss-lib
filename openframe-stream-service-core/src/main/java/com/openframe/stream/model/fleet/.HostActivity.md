A simple data model representing the relationship between a host and an activity in the fleet management system, using Jackson annotations for JSON serialization.

## Key Components

- **HostActivity class**: POJO with Lombok's `@Data` annotation for automatic getter/setter generation
- **hostId**: Integer field mapped to "host_id" in JSON
- **activityId**: Integer field mapped to "activity_id" in JSON

## Usage Example

```java
// Creating a new host activity relationship
HostActivity hostActivity = new HostActivity();
hostActivity.setHostId(123);
hostActivity.setActivityId(456);

// JSON serialization will produce:
// {"host_id": 123, "activity_id": 456}

// Deserializing from JSON
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
String json = """
{
    "host_id": 789,
    "activity_id": 321
}
""";
HostActivity activity = mapper.readValue(json, HostActivity.class);
```

This class is typically used for API requests/responses or database operations where you need to associate hosts with specific activities in the fleet system.
