Defines constants for source event types from integrated security and device management tools (MeshCentral, Tactical RMM, and Fleet MDM). Provides a centralized location for event type mappings used in stream processing and event handling.

## Key Components

- **`MeshCentral`** - Server, user, mesh/group, node/device, relay, and user group event types
- **`Tactical`** - Authentication, device management, script automation, policy, monitoring, and system event types  
- **`Fleet`** - User management, device enrollment, MDM policies, configuration profiles, and software management event types

Each interface contains string constants representing specific event types emitted by the respective tools.

## Usage Example

```java
// Using MeshCentral event types
if (eventType.equals(SourceEventTypes.MeshCentral.USER_LOGIN)) {
    processUserLoginEvent(event);
}

// Using Tactical RMM event types for script execution
switch (eventType) {
    case SourceEventTypes.Tactical.SCRIPT_EXECUTION_STARTED:
        handleScriptStart(event);
        break;
    case SourceEventTypes.Tactical.SCRIPT_EXECUTION_FINISHED:
        handleScriptComplete(event);
        break;
}

// Using Fleet MDM event types for device management
if (eventType.equals(SourceEventTypes.Fleet.MDM_ENROLLED)) {
    processDeviceEnrollment(event);
}
```

This interface enables type-safe event handling and ensures consistent event type references across the stream mapping system.
