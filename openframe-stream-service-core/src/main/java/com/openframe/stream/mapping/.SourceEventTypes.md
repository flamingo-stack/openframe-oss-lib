Defines source event type constants for integrating with three key remote management tools: MeshCentral, Tactical RMM, and Fleet MDM. This interface provides a centralized, organized way to reference event types from these external systems for stream processing and mapping.

## Key Components

**Main Interface**: `SourceEventTypes` - Root interface containing nested interfaces for each tool
- **MeshCentral** - Server management, user authentication, device/node operations, and relay events
- **Tactical** - RMM platform events including agent management, scripts, policies, and monitoring
- **Fleet** - MDM events covering device enrollment, user management, policies, and mobile device operations

## Usage Example

```java
import com.openframe.stream.mapping.SourceEventTypes;

// Reference MeshCentral events
String userLoginEvent = SourceEventTypes.MeshCentral.USER_LOGIN;
String nodeAddEvent = SourceEventTypes.MeshCentral.NODE_ADD;

// Reference Tactical RMM events  
String agentInstallEvent = SourceEventTypes.Tactical.AGENT_INSTALL;
String scriptRunEvent = SourceEventTypes.Tactical.SCRIPT_EXECUTION_STARTED;

// Reference Fleet MDM events
String deviceEnrollEvent = SourceEventTypes.Fleet.MDM_ENROLLED;
String policyCreateEvent = SourceEventTypes.Fleet.CREATED_POLICY;

// Use in event processing
if (eventType.equals(SourceEventTypes.MeshCentral.USER_LOGIN)) {
    processUserLogin(event);
}
```

The interface organizes over 100 event types across categories like authentication, device management, policy enforcement, and system administration, providing type-safe constants for event stream processing.
