A utility class that provides mapping between Fleet MDM activity type codes and their human-readable messages, covering comprehensive Fleet management operations from device enrollment to policy management.

## Key Components

- **ACTIVITY_TYPE_MESSAGES** - Static map containing all Fleet MDM activity types and their corresponding human-readable messages
- **getMessage(String)** - Retrieves human-readable message for a given activity type, returns Optional
- **isSupported(String)** - Checks if an activity type is supported in the mapping
- **createActivityTypeMessages()** - Private method that initializes the complete activity type mapping

## Usage Example

```java
// Get human-readable message for an activity type
Optional<String> message = FleetActivityTypeMapping.getMessage("created_policy");
if (message.isPresent()) {
    System.out.println(message.get()); // Outputs: "Created policy"
}

// Check if activity type is supported
boolean supported = FleetActivityTypeMapping.isSupported("live_query");
System.out.println(supported); // Outputs: true

// Handle unknown activity types
String unknownType = "unknown_activity";
String displayMessage = FleetActivityTypeMapping.getMessage(unknownType)
    .orElse("Unknown activity: " + unknownType);
```

The mapping covers major Fleet MDM operations including policy management, device enrollment, user management, software installation, security configurations, and MDM platform support across macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android platforms.
