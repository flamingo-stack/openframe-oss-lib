This utility class provides centralized mapping between tool-specific event types and standardized unified event types across different integrated tools. It serves as a translation layer for event normalization in the stream processing pipeline.

## Key Components

- **`mapToUnifiedType()`** - Main mapping method that translates tool-specific events to unified types
- **`registerMapping()`** - Private method to register new event type mappings
- **`initializeDefaultMappings()`** - Initializes comprehensive mappings for MeshCentral and Tactical RMM tools
- **`mappings`** - Static map storing all event type translations with "tool:eventType" keys

## Usage Example

```java
// Map a MeshCentral user login event
UnifiedEventType unified = EventTypeMapper.mapToUnifiedType(
    IntegratedToolType.MESHCENTRAL, 
    "user.login"
);
// Returns: UnifiedEventType.LOGIN

// Map a Tactical RMM device registration
UnifiedEventType deviceEvent = EventTypeMapper.mapToUnifiedType(
    IntegratedToolType.TACTICAL,
    "agent.add" 
);
// Returns: UnifiedEventType.DEVICE_REGISTERED

// Handle unmapped event types
UnifiedEventType unknown = EventTypeMapper.mapToUnifiedType(
    IntegratedToolType.MESHCENTRAL,
    "custom.event"
);
// Returns: UnifiedEventType.UNKNOWN (with debug logging)
```

The mapper supports extensive event categories including authentication, device management, user operations, system monitoring, and compliance checking across both MeshCentral and Tactical RMM platforms.
