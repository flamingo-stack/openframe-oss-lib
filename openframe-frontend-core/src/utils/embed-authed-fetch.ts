/**
 * Shared `fetch` wrapper for any embedded surface (chat, ticket center,
 * future widgets) that needs to carry the bearer-act-as identity
 * (proxy `Authorization` + `X-Chat-Act-As` headers from
 * `embed-proxy-auth-storage.ts`).
 *
 * Wire header names are `X-Chat-*` for historical reasons — that's a
 * server contract, not a UI namespace. The wrapper itself is generic.
 *
 * Drop-in replacement for `fetch()` — `Authorization` / `X-Chat-Act-As`
 * are merged into `init.headers` when proxy creds are stashed in
 * sessionStorage, otherwise the call falls through to the cookie-auth
 * path unchanged.
 *
 * Use this for any client-side fetch hitting `/api/chat/*`, `/api/docs/chat/*`,
 * or `/api/storage/generate-upload-url` (chat-attachment surface — shared
 * with the ticket center). Routes that do NOT need bearer-act-as
 * (e.g. `/api/profile/me`) keep using vanilla `fetch`.

/**
 * Hosts that have their own auth model (cookie sessions, app-specific
 * JWT in localStorage, OAuth access tokens, …) can register an adapter
 * to override the lib's default `embedProxyAuth` flow. When set, the
 * adapter's `getHeaders()` result is merged onto every `embedAuthedFetch`
 * call AFTER the default proxy-auth header step (so adapter headers
 * win over both caller and proxy values), and `credentials` overrides
 * the default `'same-origin'` behaviour.
 *
 * Default (no adapter): MPH-style proxy-impersonation — bearer + act-as
 * read from localStorage, `credentials: 'same-origin'`. No consumer
 * needs to touch this unless they want a different auth model.
 *
 * Use cases:
 *   - openframe-frontend has its own JWT in `localStorage.of_access_token`
 *     and cookie-based session; register an adapter to attach the JWT
 *     and request `credentials: 'include'` so cookies travel cross-origin
 *     to the openframe gateway.
 *   - Future embed hosts with OAuth access tokens, signed URLs, etc.
 *
 * Lifetime: setter is module-level (intentionally — `embedAuthedFetch`
 * is a plain utility, not a hook, so it can't read React context). Host
 * runtime providers should call `setEmbedAuthAdapter(...)` on mount and
 * `setEmbedAuthAdapter(null)` on unmount. Multiple hosts registering at
 * once is a programming error (one chat panel per app).

 * **Header merge direction (proxy WINS over caller):** the implementation
 * spreads `baseHeaders` first inside `applyProxyAuth`, then sets the
 * `Authorization` / `X-Chat-*` keys — so the proxy values take precedence
 * over anything the caller passed. The motivation is that the bearer +
 * act-as identity is the source of truth for embedded auth; a caller
 * accidentally passing a stale `Authorization` header should NOT override
 * the live proxy creds.
 *
 * **Cross-origin defense:** the wrapper assumes a same-origin `/api/…`
 * relative URL. Absolute URLs are accepted only when their origin matches
 * the current window's origin; cross-origin URLs throw before the bearer
 * leaves the page. This is a defense-in-depth guard for future call sites
 * — there is no legitimate cross-origin use of this fetch wrapper.
 *
 * **401 self-heal:** when a registered adapter supplies `refresh`, a `401`
 * response triggers a single token refresh + retry of the same request
 * (see `EmbedAuthAdapter.refresh`). This is the openframe `apiClient`'s
 * refresh-then-retry behaviour, lifted into the lib so embedded surfaces
 * no longer need a host-side `window.fetch` monkey-patch to survive an
 * expired access token mid-chat. With no adapter (or no `refresh`), the
 * 401 passes straight through unchanged.
