Storybook stories configuration file that defines interactive documentation and test cases for the SelectableDeviceCard component, showcasing various states including selection, device types, and group interactions.

## Key Components

- **Meta Configuration**: Storybook metadata with component controls and documentation
- **Story Variants**: Eight different story configurations demonstrating component states
- **Interactive Examples**: Stories with React hooks for dynamic selection behavior
- **Device Type Demos**: Examples for desktop, laptop, server, and mobile device types
- **Selection Group**: Multi-card selection scenario with state management

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { SelectableDeviceCard } from './SelectableDeviceCard.stories'

// Basic story usage in Storybook
const basicExample = Default.args // { title: 'MacBook Pro', type: 'laptop' }

// Interactive story with state
const interactiveStory = Interactive.render({
  title: 'My Device',
  type: 'desktop'
})

// Selection group pattern
const selectionGroup = SelectionGroup.decorators[0]()
```

The stories cover essential use cases including default states, selected states, subtitle variations, different device types (desktop, laptop, server), custom icons, and interactive selection groups. Each story includes proper controls for testing different props and demonstrates real-world usage patterns for device selection interfaces.
