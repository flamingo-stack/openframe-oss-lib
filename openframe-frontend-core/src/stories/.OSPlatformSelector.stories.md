A Storybook stories file that provides interactive examples and documentation for the OSPlatformSelector component, demonstrating various configurations including disabled states, badges, and different platform selections.

## Key Components

- **InteractiveSelector** - Wrapper component that manages state for interactive Storybook stories
- **Story variants** - Multiple story configurations showcasing different use cases:
  - Default states for each platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Label and badge configurations
  - Disabled platform states
  - Icon size variations
  - Full-width layouts

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OSPlatformSelector } from '../components/features/os-platform-selector'
import type { OSPlatformId } from '../utils/os-platforms'

// Basic usage with state management
const [platform, setPlatform] = useState<OSPlatformId>('darwin')

<OSPlatformSelector
  value={platform}
  onValueChange={setPlatform}
  label="Select Platform"
/>

// With disabled platforms and badges
<OSPlatformSelector
  value={platform}
  onValueChange={setPlatform}
  options={[
    { platformId: 'windows' },
    { platformId: 'darwin' },
    { 
      platformId: 'linux', 
      disabled: true, 
      badge: { text: 'Coming Soon', colorScheme: 'cyan' } 
    },
  ]}
/>
```

The stories demonstrate the component's flexibility with different states, styling options, and interactive behaviors, making it easy for developers to understand and implement the OSPlatformSelector in their applications.
