A client-side only wrapper component that prevents hydration mismatches by delaying header rendering until after the client-side JavaScript loads. It displays a skeleton component during the initial server-side render.

## Key Components

- **`ClientOnlyHeaderProps`** - Interface defining the component props with header configuration and optional skeleton
- **`ClientOnlyHeader`** - Main component that conditionally renders based on client-side hydration state
- **`isClient` state** - Boolean state that tracks whether the component has hydrated on the client

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ClientOnlyHeader } from './client-only-header';

// Basic usage with default skeleton
<ClientOnlyHeader 
  config={{ 
    title: "My App",
    showNavigation: true 
  }} 
/>

// With custom skeleton
<ClientOnlyHeader 
  config={{ 
    title: "My App",
    showNavigation: true 
  }}
  skeleton={<div className="custom-loading">Loading header...</div>}
/>
```

This pattern is useful when the header contains client-specific logic that might cause hydration mismatches between server and client renders, ensuring a smooth user experience during the initial page load.
