<!-- source-hash: 5a3bed11c9b0686b28fc7626e02b503e -->
A React FAQ accordion component with smooth animations and keyboard accessibility, featuring expandable/collapsible sections with height transitions.

## Key Components

- **`FaqItem`** - Interface defining FAQ structure with id, question, and answer
- **`FaqAccordion`** - Main accordion component with toggle functionality
- **`useMeasuredHeight`** - Custom hook for measuring and animating content height
- **`toggle`** - Function to handle expanding/collapsing individual FAQ items

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { FaqAccordion, FaqItem } from './faq-accordion'

const faqData: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What is OpenFrame?",
    answer: "OpenFrame is a decentralized platform for creative applications."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: "You can start by installing the OpenFrame client and creating your first frame."
  }
]

export default function HelpPage() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <FaqAccordion 
        items={faqData}
        defaultOpenIds={[1]} // First item open by default
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component uses a `Set` for tracking open items, supports keyboard navigation (Enter/Space), and includes smooth height animations with opacity transitions. The `useMeasuredHeight` hook efficiently measures content height only when needed to enable smooth expand/collapse animations.
