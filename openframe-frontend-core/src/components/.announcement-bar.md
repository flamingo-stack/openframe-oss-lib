A React component that displays dismissible announcement banners fetched from an API with platform-specific storage and automatic refresh capabilities.

## Key Components

- **AnnouncementBar**: Main component that renders announcement bars with icons, text, and optional CTA buttons
- **State Management**: Manages announcement data, visibility, and dismissal state with localStorage persistence
- **Platform Integration**: Uses `getAppType()` for platform-specific storage keys and API calls
- **Icon Rendering**: Supports both SVG icons via `renderSvgIcon` and PNG images
- **Responsive Design**: Different layouts and interactions for mobile vs desktop

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { AnnouncementBar } from './announcement-bar';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      {/* Announcement bar will automatically fetch and display active announcements */}
      <AnnouncementBar />
      
      {/* Rest of your app content */}
      <main>
        {/* Your content here */}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component automatically:
- Fetches announcements from `/api/announcements/active`
- Caches responses in localStorage with platform-specific keys
- Respects user dismissals per announcement ID
- Refreshes every 60 seconds
- Handles mobile/desktop responsive behavior
- Supports customizable styling via announcement configuration
