A client-side React component that displays a dismissible announcement bar across the top of the application. The component fetches active announcements from the server, handles platform-specific caching and dismissal states, and provides responsive mobile-first design with optional CTA buttons.

## Key Components

- **AnnouncementBar**: Main React component that manages announcement display state and user interactions
- **fetchActiveAnnouncement()**: Async function that retrieves active announcements from `/api/announcements/active`
- **handleDismiss()**: User action handler that stores dismissal state in localStorage with platform-specific keys
- **handleCtaClick()**: CTA button click handler that opens links based on target preference
- **renderIcon()**: Helper that renders either PNG images or SVG icons using the icon-utils system
- **getSvgIcon()**: Wrapper function that standardizes SVG icon rendering with responsive sizing

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { AnnouncementBar } from './components/announcement-bar';

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <AnnouncementBar />
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
}

// The component automatically:
// - Fetches announcements on mount
// - Uses cached data for instant rendering
// - Refreshes every 5 minutes
// - Handles platform-specific dismissals (OpenFrame vs Flamingo)
// - Provides mobile-optimized interactions
```

The component integrates with the announcement storage utilities and respects platform-specific configuration through the app-config system, ensuring proper data isolation between different application contexts.
