A React component that displays a "Why It Matters" section featuring numbered benefit items in a styled card layout. Built for marketing/landing pages to highlight key value propositions.

## Key Components

- **`WhyItMattersItemProps`** - Interface defining props for individual benefit items (number, title, description, isLast)
- **`WhyItMattersItem`** - Individual list item component with hover effects and responsive layout
- **`WhyItMatters`** - Main section component that renders the complete benefits list with predefined content

## Usage Example

```typescript
import WhyItMatters from './why-it-matters';

// Use in a landing page or marketing section
function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other sections */}
      <WhyItMatters />
      {/* More content */}
    </div>
  );
}

// The component comes with predefined benefits:
// 1. Cut Costs - Eliminate vendor fees
// 2. Stay in Control - Full visibility and data ownership  
// 3. Build What You Need - Customize without limitations
// 4. Scale Freely - Multi-tenant MSP environments
```

The component features a dark theme with custom fonts (Azeret Mono, DM Sans), hover animations, responsive design (mobile-first with MD breakpoints), and uses ODS design system classes for consistent theming. Each item displays as a numbered list with accent-colored numbers and structured typography hierarchy.
