A centralized export file that provides the complete onboarding component library, exposing walkthrough components and state management hooks for building guided user experiences.

## Key Components

**Components:**
- `OnboardingWalkthrough` - Main container component for creating step-by-step user onboarding flows
- `OnboardingStepCard` - Individual step component for displaying onboarding content and navigation

**Hooks:**
- `useOnboardingState` - Custom hook for managing onboarding state, step progression, and completion tracking

**Types:**
- `OnboardingWalkthroughProps` - Configuration props for the main walkthrough container
- `OnboardingStepCardProps` - Props interface for individual step cards
- `OnboardingState` - State object containing current step, completion status, and navigation methods
- `OnboardingStepConfig` - Configuration interface for defining individual onboarding steps

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { 
  OnboardingWalkthrough, 
  OnboardingStepCard, 
  useOnboardingState,
  type OnboardingStepConfig 
} from './components/onboarding'

function MyOnboarding() {
  const steps: OnboardingStepConfig[] = [
    { id: 'welcome', title: 'Welcome', content: 'Get started with our platform' },
    { id: 'setup', title: 'Setup', content: 'Configure your account' }
  ]
  
  const onboardingState = useOnboardingState(steps)
  
  return (
    <OnboardingWalkthrough {...onboardingState}>
      {steps.map(step => (
        <OnboardingStepCard key={step.id} step={step} />
      ))}
    </OnboardingWalkthrough>
  )
}
```

This barrel export pattern simplifies imports and provides a clean API surface for the onboarding system across the application.
