A React component that displays product release information in a clickable card format with responsive layout and consistent styling.

## Key Components

- **ProductReleaseCard** - Main component that renders release information including title, summary, version, and date
- **ProductReleaseCardProps** - TypeScript interface defining component props including title, summary, version, formattedDate, onClick handler, and optional className
- **InteractiveCard** - Underlying card component that provides click functionality and base styling

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ProductReleaseCard } from './product-release-card'

function ReleasesPage() {
  const handleReleaseClick = () => {
    // Navigate to release details
    router.push('/releases/v2.1.0')
  }

  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <ProductReleaseCard
        title="Enhanced Dashboard Analytics"
        summary="New visualization tools and improved performance metrics for better insights into your data."
        version="v2.1.0"
        formattedDate="March 15, 2024"
        onClick={handleReleaseClick}
        className="hover:shadow-lg"
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component features a responsive two-column layout that stacks on mobile devices, with the left column containing the title and summary, and the right column displaying version information, date, and a chevron icon indicating interactivity.
