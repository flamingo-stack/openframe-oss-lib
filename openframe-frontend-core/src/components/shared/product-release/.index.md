- **ProductReleaseCardSkeleton** - Loading skeleton component for release cards
- **ReleaseDetailPage** - Main component for detailed release information display
- **ReleaseDetailSkeleton** - Loading skeleton for the release detail page

## Key Types

- **ProductReleaseCardProps** / **ProductReleaseCardSkeletonProps** - Component prop interfaces
- **ReleaseDetailPageProps** - Props for the main release detail component
- **MarkdownRendererProps** - Props for rendering markdown content
- **RoadmapItem** / **RoadmapSectionProps** - Types for roadmap functionality
- **DeliveryResponse** / **DeliverySectionProps** - Types for delivery information

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { 
  ProductReleaseCard, 
  ReleaseDetailPage,
  type RoadmapItem 
} from './index'

// Use the release card component
<ProductReleaseCard 
  title="Feature Release v2.1"
  description="New dashboard features"
/>

// Use the detail page
<ReleaseDetailPage
