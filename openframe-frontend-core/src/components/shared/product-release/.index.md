A client-side module that exports components and types for displaying product releases and roadmap information in the Flamingo platform.

## Key Components

- **ProductReleaseCard** - Component for displaying individual product release cards with associated props type
- **ProductReleaseCardSkeleton** - Loading skeleton component for product release cards  
- **ReleaseDetailPage** - Main component for rendering detailed release pages with markdown content and roadmap sections
- **ReleaseDetailSkeleton** - Loading skeleton for the release detail page
- **Type Exports** - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces including `MarkdownRendererProps`, `RoadmapItem`, `DeliveryResponse`, and section-specific prop types

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { 
  ProductReleaseCard, 
  ReleaseDetailPage,
  ProductReleaseCardSkeleton,
  type RoadmapItem 
} from './index'

// Display a product release card
<ProductReleaseCard 
  title="OpenFrame v2.1"
  description="Enhanced AI automation features"
  releaseDate="2024-03-15"
/>

// Show loading state
<ProductReleaseCardSkeleton />

// Render detailed release page with roadmap
<ReleaseDetailPage 
  releaseId="v2.1"
  markdownContent={content}
  roadmapItems={roadmapData}
/>
```

The module follows the "use client" directive, indicating these components are designed for client-side rendering in Next.js applications and likely include interactive features for browsing Flamingo's product releases and development roadmap.
