A React search input component with controlled/uncontrolled state management, loading states, and customizable icons that provides real-time search functionality with a dark-themed design.

## Key Components

- **SearchBar**: Main component that renders a search input with optional icon
- **SearchBarProps**: TypeScript interface defining component props including callbacks, styling, and state options
- **State Management**: Supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes with internal state fallback
- **Icons**: Configurable left-side icon with loading spinner support using Lucide React icons

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { SearchBar } from './search-bar'
import { Filter } from 'lucide-react'

// Basic usage
<SearchBar 
  placeholder="Search documents..." 
  onSubmit={(value) => console.log('Search:', value)} 
/>

// Controlled with custom icon and loading state
<SearchBar
  value={searchTerm}
  icon={<Filter />}
  loading={isSearching}
  onSubmit={handleSearch}
  className="max-w-md"
  disabled={!isReady}
/>

// Uncontrolled with custom styling
<SearchBar 
  placeholder="Type to filter results..."
  onSubmit={(query) => filterResults(query)}
  className="border-blue-500"
/>
```

The component automatically handles real-time search updates, supports both controlled and uncontrolled patterns, and includes accessibility features like proper focus states and keyboard navigation.
