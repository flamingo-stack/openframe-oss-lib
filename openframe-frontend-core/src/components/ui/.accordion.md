A React accordion component built on top of Radix UI that provides collapsible content sections with smooth animations. The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes automatic chevron rotation and content transitions.

## Key Components

- **`Accordion`** - Root container component (re-export of Radix AccordionPrimitive.Root)
- **`AccordionItem`** - Individual accordion section with bottom border styling
- **`AccordionTrigger`** - Clickable header that toggles content visibility with chevron icon
- **`AccordionContent`** - Collapsible content area with smooth up/down animations

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, AccordionContent } from "./accordion"

export function FAQSection() {
  return (
    <Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
      <AccordionItem value="item-1">
        <AccordionTrigger>What is your return policy?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          We offer a 30-day return policy for all unused items in original packaging.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
      
      <AccordionItem value="item-2">
        <AccordionTrigger>How long does shipping take?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Standard shipping takes 3-5 business days within the continental US.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  )
}
```

The component supports all Radix UI accordion props including `type="single"` for one-at-a-time expansion or `type="multiple"` for multiple open sections.
