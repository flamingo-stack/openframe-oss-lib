<!-- source-hash: 081b5c3b13b2ad86e0cfa2882aaec148 -->
A client-side React component that displays brand association information as a structured card with an icon, title, description, and external link button.

## Key Components

**Interfaces:**
- `BrandAssociationItem` - Data structure defining the card content (icon, title, description, button text, and link)
- `BrandAssociationCardProps` - Component props interface

**Components:**
- `BrandAssociationCard` - Main card component that renders brand association information
- `renderIcon()` - Helper function that handles both React elements and component types for flexible icon rendering

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { BrandAssociationCard } from './brand-association-card';
import { Star } from 'lucide-react';

const brandItem = {
  icon: Star,
  title: "Premium Partners",
  description: "Discover our curated selection of premium brand partners offering exclusive products and services.",
  buttonText: "Partners",
  link: "https://example.com/partners"
};

function App() {
  return (
    <BrandAssociationCard 
      item={brandItem}
      className="max-w-md"
    />
  );
}
```

The component automatically opens links in new tabs and supports both Lucide React icons and custom React elements as icons.
