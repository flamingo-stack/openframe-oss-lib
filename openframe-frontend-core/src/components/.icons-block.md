A responsive client-side component that displays a grid of icons with dynamic column sizing based on viewport width and smart adjacent icon filtering to prevent visual clustering.

## Key Components

- **ResponsiveIconsBlock**: Main component that renders a responsive 2-row grid of icons
- **availableIcons**: Static array containing custom icons from stub file and Lucide React icons
- **IconsBlockProps**: Interface defining optional `loading` prop for placeholder state control
- **Dynamic grid generation**: Algorithm that prevents adjacent duplicate icons using position-based filtering

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ResponsiveIconsBlock } from './icons-block';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Default behavior - shows placeholder until grid loads */}
      <ResponsiveIconsBlock />
      
      {/* Force loading state */}
      <ResponsiveIconsBlock loading={true} />
      
      {/* Responsive grid that adapts to screen width */}
      <ResponsiveIconsBlock loading={false} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component automatically calculates columns based on viewport width (56px per column + 4 buffer), uses deterministic pseudo-random placement to ensure consistent layouts across renders, and includes responsive sizing with Tailwind classes. Icons are displayed with grayscale styling and proper grid borders for a cohesive visual presentation.
