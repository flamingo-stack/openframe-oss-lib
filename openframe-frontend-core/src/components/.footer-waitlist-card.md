A React component that displays a promotional footer card for the OpenFrame waitlist signup, with smart navigation handling for both existing waitlist pages and external navigation.

## Key Components

- **FooterWaitlistCard**: Main component that renders a styled card with OpenFrame branding
- **handleClick**: Navigation logic that either scrolls to existing form or navigates to waitlist page
- **JoinWaitlistButton**: Reusable button component with custom styling props

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { FooterWaitlistCard } from './footer-waitlist-card';

// In your layout or footer component
export function AppFooter() {
  return (
    <footer className="p-4">
      <FooterWaitlistCard />
    </footer>
  );
}
```

The component intelligently handles two scenarios:
- **On waitlist page**: Smoothly scrolls to the existing form and focuses the email input
- **On other pages**: Navigates to `/waitlist#waitlist-form` with anchor targeting

Features responsive design with mobile-optimized padding (`p-4 md:p-6`) and uses custom colors for the button styling including branded yellows and grays that match the OpenFrame design system.
