A footer card component that promotes the OpenFrame product and provides navigation to the waitlist signup form with smooth scrolling functionality.

## Key Components

- **FooterWaitlistCard**: Main component that renders a promotional card with product information and a call-to-action button
- **handleClick**: Navigation handler that either scrolls to existing waitlist form or redirects to waitlist page
- **JoinWaitlistButton**: Custom button component for waitlist signup with configurable styling

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { FooterWaitlistCard } from './footer-waitlist-card';

export function PageFooter() {
  return (
    <footer className="container mx-auto px-4">
      <FooterWaitlistCard />
    </footer>
  );
}

// The component automatically handles navigation:
// - If on /waitlist page: scrolls to #waitlist-form and focuses email input
// - If on other pages: navigates to /waitlist#waitlist-form
```

The component uses Next.js navigation hooks and implements smart behavior - when already on the waitlist page, it smoothly scrolls to the form and focuses the email input. Otherwise, it navigates to the waitlist page with a URL fragment to target the form section.
