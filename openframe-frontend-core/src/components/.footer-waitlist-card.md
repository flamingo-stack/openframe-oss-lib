A React component that renders a promotional waitlist card for OpenFrame, featuring smart navigation behavior that either scrolls to an existing form or navigates to the waitlist page.

## Key Components

- **FooterWaitlistCard**: Main component that displays OpenFrame promotional content with a call-to-action button
- **handleClick**: Smart navigation handler that detects current page context and either scrolls to existing form or navigates to waitlist page
- **OpenFrameLogo**: Custom logo component with configurable colors for the button icon
- **Button**: UI component with left icon support for the call-to-action

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { FooterWaitlistCard } from './footer-waitlist-card';

function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer className="p-6">
      <FooterWaitlistCard />
    </footer>
  );
}

// The component handles two scenarios automatically:
// 1. On /waitlist page: Scrolls to #waitlist-form anchor and focuses email input
// 2. On other pages: Navigates to /waitlist#waitlist-form
```

The component uses Next.js navigation hooks and implements smooth scrolling with automatic email input focus when already on the waitlist page. It features a responsive design with OpenFrame branding and a distinctive call-to-action button with the OpenFrame logo.
