This index file serves as the main export barrel for OpenFrame platform components, providing a centralized entry point for device management, software inventory, and system information display components.

## Key Components

- **SoftwareInfo** - Component for displaying software package information
- **SoftwareSourceBadge** - Badge component for showing software source origins
- **CveLink** - Component for rendering CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) links
- **ToolBadge** - Badge component for displaying tool types and categories
- **ShellTypeBadge** - Badge component for showing shell type information

Each component exports both the component itself and its corresponding TypeScript props interface, along with relevant type definitions from the types directory.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { 
  SoftwareInfo, 
  SoftwareSourceBadge, 
  CveLink, 
  ToolBadge, 
  ShellTypeBadge 
} from './platform-components'

// Use individual components
<SoftwareInfo packageName="nginx" version="1.20.1" />
<SoftwareSourceBadge source="apt" />
<CveLink cveId="CVE-2023-1234" />
<ToolBadge toolType="scanner" />
<ShellTypeBadge shellType="bash" />
```

This barrel export pattern simplifies imports and provides a clean API for consuming OpenFrame platform components across the application.
