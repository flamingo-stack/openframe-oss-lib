A React component that displays interactive approval requests for potentially sensitive operations, allowing users to approve or reject commands with visual status feedback.

## Key Components

- **ApprovalRequestData**: Interface defining the structure of approval request data including command, description, risk level, and details
- **ApprovalRequestMessageProps**: Component props extending HTML div attributes with approval data and callback handlers
- **ApprovalRequestMessage**: Main component that renders approval UI based on status (pending, approved, rejected)
- **Status States**: Handles three states - pending (shows buttons), approved/rejected (shows status with icons)

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ApprovalRequestMessage, ApprovalRequestData } from './approval-request-message'

function ChatInterface() {
  const [requests, setRequests] = useState<ApprovalRequestData[]>([])
  
  const handleApprove = async (requestId?: string) => {
    console.log('Approved request:', requestId)
    // Execute the approved command
  }
  
  const handleReject = async (requestId?: string) => {
    console.log('Rejected request:', requestId)
    // Log rejection or notify user
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <ApprovalRequestMessage
        data={{
          command: "rm -rf /tmp/cache",
          description: "Clear temporary cache",
          risk: "medium",
          requestId: "req-123"
        }}
        onApprove={handleApprove}
        onReject={handleReject}
        status="pending"
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically handles loading states during approval/rejection processing and provides appropriate visual feedback with icons and styling for completed requests.
