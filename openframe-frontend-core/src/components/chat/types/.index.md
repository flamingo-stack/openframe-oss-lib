This TypeScript file serves as the main export barrel for type definitions, providing a centralized entry point for importing all types used throughout the system's chat, messaging, component, network, processing, and API layers.

## Key Components

The file re-exports types from six specialized modules:

- **chat.types** - Chat-related type definitions and interfaces
- **message.types** - Message structure and formatting types  
- **component.types** - UI component and React component types
- **network.types** - Network request/response and connection types
- **processing.types** - Data processing and transformation types
- **api.types** - API endpoint and service interface types

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Import specific types from the barrel export
import { ChatMessage, ApiResponse, ComponentProps } from './types'

// Or import all types with namespace
import * as Types from './types'

// Use the imported types
const message: Types.ChatMessage = {
  id: '123',
  content: 'Hello world',
  timestamp: new Date()
}

const apiCall = async (): Promise<Types.ApiResponse> => {
  // API implementation
}
```

This barrel export pattern simplifies imports across the codebase by allowing consumers to import multiple related types from a single source rather than importing from individual type files.
