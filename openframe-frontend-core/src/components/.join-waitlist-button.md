A specialized button component for OpenFrame waitlist registration that provides consistent branding and loading states across the application.

## Key Components

- **`JoinWaitlistButtonProps`** - Interface extending Button props with custom color options and loading state
- **`JoinWaitlistButton`** - React component with forwardRef for consistent waitlist CTA styling
- **OpenFrame Logo Integration** - Displays branded logo icon when not in loading state

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { JoinWaitlistButton } from './join-waitlist-button';

// Basic usage with default styling
<JoinWaitlistButton onClick={handleJoinWaitlist} />

// With custom colors and loading state
<JoinWaitlistButton
  loading={isSubmitting}
  buttonBackgroundColor="#FF6B35"
  buttonTextColor="#FFFFFF"
  lowerPathColor="#FFFFFF"
  upperPathColor="#FF6B35"
>
  Join Beta Program
</JoinWaitlistButton>

// With custom styling
<JoinWaitlistButton
  className="w-full md:w-auto"
  disabled={!isFormValid}
  onClick={handleSubmit}
/>
```

The component automatically handles the loading state by replacing the OpenFrame logo with a spinner and uses the primary yellow variant with touch-optimized sizing by default. The logo colors can be customized to match different design contexts while maintaining brand consistency.
