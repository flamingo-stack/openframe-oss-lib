An index file that exports file and document-related icon components for the OpenFrame AI platform's icon library.

## Key Components

This index file provides centralized access to 74 file and document-related icon components, organized into several categories:

- **Clipboard Icons** - Various clipboard states with different indicators (check, exclamation, info, etc.)
- **File Icons** - Comprehensive file type and state icons (audio, image, code, locked, etc.)
- **Folder Icons** - Directory management icons with various states and modifiers
- **Document Actions** - Copy, paste, pin, paperclip, and attachment icons
- **Content Types** - Specialized icons for stickers, memos, and newspapers

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { 
  FileIcon, 
  FolderIcon, 
  ClipboardCheckIcon,
  Copy01Icon 
} from './index';

// Use in a file manager component
function FileManagerComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FileIcon className="w-6 h-6" />
      <FolderIcon className="w-6 h-6" />
      <ClipboardCheckIcon className="w-4 h-4 text-green-500" />
      <Copy01Icon className="w-4 h-4 cursor-pointer" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This barrel export pattern allows developers to import any file/document-related icon from a single location, making it easier to manage dependencies and maintain consistency across the OpenFrame platform's file management interfaces.
