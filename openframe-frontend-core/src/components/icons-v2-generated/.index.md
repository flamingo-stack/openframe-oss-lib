This file serves as the main entry point for a comprehensive icon library, providing a centralized export for all icon categories used throughout the Flamingo platform.

## Key Components

- **Category Exports**: Re-exports from 28 different icon category modules covering everything from basic interface elements to specialized domains like finance, health, and media playback
- **Barrel Pattern**: Implements the barrel export pattern to simplify imports and provide a single source for all icon components
- **Organized Structure**: Icons are logically grouped by domain (e.g., `communication`, `devices`, `security`) for better maintainability

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Import specific icons from categories
import { HomeIcon, SettingsIcon } from './icons';
import { PlayIcon, PauseIcon } from './icons';

// Or import entire categories if needed
import * as CommunicationIcons from './icons/communication';
import * as MediaIcons from './icons/media-playback';

// Use in React components
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <HomeIcon className="nav-icon" />
      <SettingsIcon className="settings-btn" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This barrel export allows consumers to import any icon from a single location while maintaining the organized category structure underneath, making it easy to discover and use icons across the Flamingo platform's various interfaces.
