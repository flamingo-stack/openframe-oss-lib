<!-- source-hash: fb28f08c07507e7553f63e04b42b909d -->
A React component that renders a call-to-action section for joining the OpenFrame waitlist, featuring the logo, messaging, and smart navigation handling.

## Key Components

- **JoinWaitlistCTA** - Main component with customizable behavior and styling
- **JoinWaitlistCTAProps** - Interface defining component props including optional custom handlers and loading states
- **defaultHandler** - Smart navigation logic that scrolls to form if on waitlist page or navigates to `/waitlist#waitlist-form`
- **OpenFrameLogo** - Branded logo component with custom colors
- **JoinWaitlistButton** - Interactive button with loading state support
- **ResponsiveIconsBlock** - Icon grid display in the bottom section

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Basic usage with default navigation
<JoinWaitlistCTA />

// With custom handler and loading state
<JoinWaitlistCTA 
  onJoin={() => handleCustomJoin()}
  loading={isSubmitting}
  showBottomText={false}
  className="mt-8"
/>

// Minimal version without bottom text
<JoinWaitlistCTA showBottomText={false} />
```

The component automatically handles navigation between pages and smooth scrolling to the waitlist form when already on the waitlist page, making it suitable for use across different sections of the application.
