A responsive "Made with love by Flamingo" footer component that adapts to different screen sizes and provides customizable styling options.

## Key Components

- **MadeWithLove**: Main React component with responsive behavior and hover effects
- **MadeWithLoveProps**: TypeScript interface defining component props (className, size, showOnMobile)
- **FlamingoLogo**: Imported logo component with configurable size and color
- **getBaseUrl**: Utility function for generating the Flamingo website URL

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { MadeWithLove } from './made-with-love';

// Basic usage
<MadeWithLove />

// With custom sizing and mobile visibility
<MadeWithLove 
  size="lg" 
  showOnMobile={false}
  className="custom-footer"
/>

// Small variant for compact layouts
<MadeWithLove size="sm" />
```

The component automatically detects screen size changes and adjusts typography accordingly. It features three size variants (sm, md, lg) with corresponding font sizes and logo dimensions. The component uses inline styles for maximum compatibility across different CSS frameworks and includes hover effects with underline text decoration.
