A React component for managing expandable changelog entries with add, edit, and delete functionality.

## Key Components

- **ChangelogManager**: Main component that renders a list of expandable changelog entries
- **ChangelogManagerProps**: Interface defining component props including entries array, onChange callback, and expandAll option
- **ChangelogEntry**: Type for individual entries with title and description fields

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ChangelogManager } from './changelog-manager';
import { ChangelogEntry } from '../../types/product-release';

function ProductReleaseForm() {
  const [features, setFeatures] = useState<ChangelogEntry[]>([]);
  const [expandAll, setExpandAll] = useState(false);

  return (
    <ChangelogManager
      title="New Features"
      entries={features}
      onChange={setFeatures}
      expandAll={expandAll}
      className="mb-6"
    />
  );
}
```

The component provides an accordion-style interface where users can:
- Add new changelog entries with a "+" button
- Expand/collapse entries to edit title and description
- Delete entries with a trash icon
- Auto-expand all entries when `expandAll` prop is set to true (useful after AI enrichment)

Each entry shows a preview of the title in the collapsed state, with full editing capabilities when expanded.
