A specialized form component for managing multiple GitHub release links with automatic URL validation and ordering capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GitHubReleaseLink**: Interface defining the structure for GitHub release entries with URL and display order
- **GitHubReleasesManager**: Main component that renders a user interface for adding, editing, and organizing GitHub release links
- **ArrayEntryManager**: Underlying generic component that handles the list management functionality

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { GitHubReleasesManager, GitHubReleaseLink } from './github-releases-manager';

function ProjectForm() {
  const [releases, setReleases] = useState<GitHubReleaseLink[]>([
    {
      github_release_url: "https://github.com/myorg/project/releases/tag/v1.0.0",
      display_order: 1
    }
  ]);

  return (
    <GitHubReleasesManager
      releases={releases}
      onChange={setReleases}
      className="mb-6"
    />
  );
}
```

The component provides a clean interface for users to manage GitHub release links with built-in validation for GitHub URL formats, drag-and-drop reordering through display_order, and intuitive add/remove functionality. It's particularly useful in project management forms where multiple release versions need to be tracked and displayed.
