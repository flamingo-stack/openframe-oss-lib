<!-- source-hash: 334f79ef37d39fafa41a9fecfc6bf342 -->
A responsive React component for embedding and viewing Figma prototypes with automatic device detection, adaptive scaling, and section-based navigation.

## Key Components

- **FigmaPrototypeViewer**: Main component with unified state management and responsive iframe embedding
- **UnifiedState**: Comprehensive state interface managing view modes, scaling, navigation, and UI states
- **ViewMode Types**: `DESKTOP`, `MOBILE`, `MOBILE_TOUCH` with automatic detection based on screen size and touch capability
- **Configuration System**: Supports environment variables and config-based setup for file keys, dimensions, and starting points
- **Scaling Engine**: Calculates optimal iframe scaling and positioning for different screen sizes
- **Section Navigation**: Integration with SectionSelector for prototype flow navigation

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { FigmaPrototypeViewer } from './figma-prototype-viewer'

const config = {
  title: "Design System Prototype",
  desktopFileKey: "abc123...",
  mobileFileKey: "def456...",
  sections: [
    {
      id: "onboarding",
      number: "01",
      title: "User Onboarding",
      startingNodeId: "123:456",
      mobileStartingNodeId: "789:012"
    }
  ],
  desktopContentDimensions: { width: 944, height: 600 },
  mobileContentDimensions: { width: 343, height: 600 }
}

function PrototypePage() {
  return (
    <FigmaPrototypeViewer 
      config={config}
      onSectionClick={(sectionId) => console.log('Section changed:', sectionId)}
    />
  )
}
```

The component automatically detects device capabilities, manages iframe states (loading, ready, reloading), and provides smooth transitions between sections. Environment variables can override config settings for deployment flexibility.
