A React component that showcases OpenFrame's open-source philosophy through a grid of feature cards with icons and descriptions, emphasizing transparency and community-driven development.

## Key Components

- **`FeatureCard`** - Individual card component displaying an icon, title, and description with hover effects
- **`OpenSourceFeatures`** - Main section component rendering a bold headline and 4-column grid of features
- **`FeatureCardProps`** - TypeScript interface defining the structure for feature card properties

## Usage Example

```typescript
import OpenSourceFeatures from './components/open-source-features';

// Use in a landing page or marketing section
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <OpenSourceFeatures />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component features a responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 4 on desktop) with cards highlighting:
- **Built on FOSS** - Transparency and community-driven development
- **Own Your Stack** - Control over tools and customization
- **Modular by Design** - Flexible architecture
- **Community-Powered** - User participation in roadmap

Each card includes hover animations and uses Lucide React icons (Terminal, DollarSign, Network, Users) with consistent ODS (OpenFrame Design System) styling and typography.
