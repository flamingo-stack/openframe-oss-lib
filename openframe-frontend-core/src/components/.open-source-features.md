A React component that displays a marketing section highlighting open-source features with an eye-catching title and feature cards grid layout.

## Key Components

- **`OpenSourceFeatures`** - Main section component with responsive grid layout
- **`FeatureCard`** - Reusable card component for individual features
- **`FeatureCardProps`** - TypeScript interface defining card props (icon, title, description)

## Usage Example

```typescript
import OpenSourceFeatures from './open-source-features';

function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other sections */}
      <OpenSourceFeatures />
      {/* More content */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Or use FeatureCard independently
import { FeatureCard } from './open-source-features';
import { Shield } from 'lucide-react';

function CustomSection() {
  return (
    <FeatureCard
      icon={<Shield className="w-6 h-6" />}
      title="Security First"
      description="Enterprise-grade security built into every component."
    />
  );
}
```

The component features a bold "100% Open-Source. 0% Bullsh*t." headline followed by four feature cards (Built on FOSS, Own Your Stack, Modular by Design, Community-Powered) in a responsive grid. Each card includes hover effects and uses Lucide React icons with custom ODS design system styling.
