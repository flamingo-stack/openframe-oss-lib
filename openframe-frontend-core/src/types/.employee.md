Defines TypeScript interfaces for employee data structures used throughout the Flamingo MSP platform, providing type safety for employee management and profile operations.

## Key Components

- **`Employee`** - Complete employee record interface with all fields including ID, personal info, and organizational data
- **`EmployeeResponse`** - API response wrapper for employee data operations with success status and employee array
- **`EmployeeProfileData`** - Subset of employee data used specifically for profile operations, excluding the ID field

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Employee, EmployeeResponse, EmployeeProfileData } from './employee';

// Creating a new employee record
const newEmployee: Employee = {
  id: "emp-123",
  full_name: "John Doe",
  department: "IT Support",
  avatar_url: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
  role: "technician",
  job_title: "Senior Support Engineer",
  about: "Experienced IT professional specializing in network infrastructure"
};

// Handling API response
const apiResponse: EmployeeResponse = {
  success: true,
  data: [newEmployee]
};

// Profile update data
const profileUpdate: EmployeeProfileData = {
  full_name: "John Smith",
  department: "IT Support",
  avatar_url: "https://example.com/new-avatar.jpg",
  role: "senior_technician",
  job_title: "Lead Support Engineer"
};
```

These interfaces ensure consistent employee data handling across the OpenFrame platform, supporting both individual employee operations and bulk data management through the unified MSP interface.
