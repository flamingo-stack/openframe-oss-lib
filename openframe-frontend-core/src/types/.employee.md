Defines TypeScript interfaces for employee data structures used throughout the application. This file provides type safety for employee-related API responses and profile management.

## Key Components

- **`Employee`** - Complete employee object with all properties including id, personal info, and profile details
- **`EmployeeResponse`** - API response wrapper containing success status and employee data array
- **`ProfileData`** - Subset of employee data used for profile operations (excludes id and about fields)

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Employee, EmployeeResponse, ProfileData } from './employee';

// API response handling
const response: EmployeeResponse = {
  success: true,
  data: [
    {
      id: "emp_123",
      full_name: "John Doe",
      department: "Engineering",
      avatar_url: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
      role: "Senior Developer",
      job_title: "Software Engineer",
      about: "Passionate full-stack developer"
    }
  ]
};

// Profile update payload
const profileUpdate: ProfileData = {
  full_name: "Jane Smith",
  department: "Design",
  avatar_url: "https://example.com/new-avatar.jpg",
  role: "Lead Designer",
  job_title: "UX Designer"
};
```
