Defines TypeScript interfaces for employee data structures used throughout the application for type safety and consistency in employee management features.

## Key Components

- **`Employee`** - Complete employee record interface with all profile fields including ID, personal details, and job information
- **`EmployeeResponse`** - API response wrapper containing success status and array of employee data
- **`ProfileData`** - Subset of employee data used for profile updates, excluding the immutable ID field

## Usage Example

```typescript
// API response handling
const response: EmployeeResponse = await fetch('/api/employees').then(r => r.json());
if (response.success) {
  const employees: Employee[] = response.data;
}

// Profile update payload
const profileUpdate: ProfileData = {
  full_name: "Jane Smith",
  department: "Engineering",
  avatar_url: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
  role: "Senior Developer",
  job_title: "Full Stack Engineer"
};

// Individual employee usage
const employee: Employee = {
  id: "emp_123",
  ...profileUpdate,
  about: "Passionate full-stack developer with 5 years experience"
};
```
