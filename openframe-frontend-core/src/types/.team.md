This file defines TypeScript interfaces for a team management system, providing type definitions for team members, organizational structure, and data retrieval options.

## Key Components

- **`TeamMember`** - Comprehensive interface for individual team member data including personal info, employment details, and profile metadata
- **`TeamSection`** - Groups team members by department with descriptive information
- **`TeamData`** - Top-level structure containing founder information and organized team sections
- **`GetTeamOptions`** - Configuration interface for filtering team data queries

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Define a team member
const member: TeamMember = {
  id: "123",
  employee_id: "EMP001",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  employment_status: "active",
  is_public: true,
  is_manager: false,
  created_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  updated_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
};

// Structure team data
const teamData: TeamData = {
  founder: member,
  sections: [{
    title: "Engineering Team",
    department: "Engineering",
    description: "Our technical team",
    members: [member]
  }]
};

// Configure team query options
const options: GetTeamOptions = {
  includeInactive: false,
  department: "Engineering"
};
```
