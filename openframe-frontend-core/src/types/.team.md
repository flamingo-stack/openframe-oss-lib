- **`TeamSection`** - Groups team members by department or functional area with title and description
- **`TeamData`** - Top-level structure containing a founder reference and organized team sections
- **`GetTeamOptions`** - Configuration interface for team data retrieval with filtering options

```typescript
// Creating a team member
const teamMember: TeamMember = {
  id: "tm_123",
  employee_id: "EMP001",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
