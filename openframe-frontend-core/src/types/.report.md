This file defines TypeScript interfaces for margin analysis reporting functionality, centralizing types used by the margin analysis wizard and DAL utilities.

## Key Components

- **`MarginReportCostStructure`** - Financial breakdown showing current costs, alternative costs, and potential savings
- **`MarginReportReplacementEntry`** - Represents a vendor replacement recommendation with current/alternative vendors and cost analysis
- **`MarginReport`** - Complete margin report containing cost analysis, recommendations, replacements, and metadata
- **`CreateMarginReportPayload`** - Input payload for triggering margin report generation through the wizard

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Creating a margin report cost structure
const costStructure: MarginReportCostStructure = {
  total_current: 50000,
  total_alternative: 35000,
  total_savings: 15000
};

// Building a replacement entry
const replacement: MarginReportReplacementEntry = {
  current_vendor: { name: "Current Provider", cost: 25000 },
  alternative_vendor: { name: "Alternative Provider", cost: 18000 },
  cost_structure: {
    total_current: 25000,
    total_alternative: 18000,
    total_savings: 7000
  }
};

// Complete margin report
const report: MarginReport = {
  id: "report-123",
  cost_structure: costStructure,
  strategic_recommendations: [],
  openframe_recommendations: [],
  replacements: [replacement],
  created_at: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

The interfaces support both the report generation workflow and the display/sharing of completed margin analysis reports.
