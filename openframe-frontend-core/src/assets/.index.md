This file serves as a centralized export point for static assets like fonts and other media files used throughout the application.

## Key Components

- **`assets`** - A constant empty object typed as immutable that will contain references to static assets such as fonts, images, and other media files

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { assets } from './index';

// Currently empty, but will be used like:
// const primaryFont = assets.fonts.primary;
// const logoImage = assets.images.logo;
```

The file is currently a placeholder with an empty assets object, but is structured to be expanded with actual asset references as the project grows. The `as const` assertion ensures the assets object remains immutable and provides better TypeScript inference for nested properties when assets are added.
