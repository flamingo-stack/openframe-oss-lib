A minimal assets module that provides a centralized export point for static assets like fonts and other resources, with platform utilities planned for future implementation.

## Key Components

- **`assets`** - A frozen empty object that serves as a placeholder for future asset exports

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { assets } from './index';

// Currently returns an empty object
console.log(assets); // {}

// Future usage might look like:
// const { fonts, images, icons } = assets;
```

This module follows a placeholder pattern, establishing the infrastructure for asset management while keeping the current implementation minimal. The `as const` assertion ensures type safety and immutability of the exported object structure.
