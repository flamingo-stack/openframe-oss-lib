This index file serves as the main export hub for API-related utilities, with important architectural constraints around React Query hooks to prevent context resolution issues.

## Key Components

Currently, this file contains no active exports due to architectural decisions:
- **Commented exports**: React Query hooks are intentionally disabled to avoid `QueryClientProvider` context issues
- **Import structure**: Designed to export types and pure fetch functions while keeping hooks at the application level

## Usage Example

```typescript
// ❌ Don't do this - hooks should stay in consuming apps
// import { useProductReleases } from '@company/ui-kit/api'

// ✅ Instead, keep hooks in your app's hook directory
// In your app: hooks/api/use-product-releases.ts
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

export const useProductReleases = () => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['product-releases'],
    queryFn: fetchProductReleases // This could come from ui-kit
  })
}

// ✅ Types and fetch functions can be imported from ui-kit
// import { ProductRelease, fetchProductReleases } from '@company/ui-kit/api'
```

This pattern ensures proper React Query context resolution while still allowing shared utilities and types across applications.
