This file serves as a centralized export point for API hooks, but is currently disabled due to React Query context resolution issues in shared component libraries.

## Key Components

**Currently Exported:**
- None (all exports are commented out)

**Commented Exports:**
- `use-product-releases` - React Query hook for product release data (disabled)

## Usage Example

This file follows the pattern of keeping React Query hooks at the application level rather than in shared UI libraries:

```typescript
// ❌ Don't do this - causes context issues
// import { useProductReleases } from '@company/ui-kit/api'

// ✅ Do this instead - keep hooks in your app
// In your app: hooks/api/use-product-releases.ts
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

export function useProductReleases() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['product-releases'],
    queryFn: () => fetch('/api/releases').then(res => res.json())
  })
}

// Then import in your components
import { useProductReleases } from '../hooks/api/use-product-releases'
```

The architecture separates shared types and fetch functions (which can be exported from ui-kit) from React Query hooks (which should remain in the consuming application to avoid QueryClientProvider context resolution problems).
