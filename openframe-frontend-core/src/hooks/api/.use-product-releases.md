React Query hooks for managing product releases with both public and admin functionality. Provides query and mutation hooks for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting product releases across platforms.

## Key Components

- **Query Keys** (`releaseKeys`): Structured cache key management for both public and admin queries
- **Public Hooks**:
  - `useReleases()`: Fetch filtered list of releases
  - `useRelease()`: Fetch single release by slug
- **Admin Hooks**:
  - `useAdminReleases()`: Fetch all releases including drafts
  - `useAdminRelease()`: Fetch single release for editing
  - `useCreateRelease()`: Create new release with optimistic updates
  - `useUpdateRelease()`: Update existing release
  - `useDeleteRelease()`: Delete release with cache invalidation

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useReleases, useCreateRelease } from './use-product-releases'

function ReleasesPage() {
  // Public releases with filtering
  const { data: releases, isLoading } = useReleases({
    tags: ['mobile', 'web'],
    release_status: ['published'],
    featured: true,
    limit: 10
  })

  // Admin create mutation
  const createRelease = useCreateRelease()

  const handleCreate = () => {
    createRelease.mutate({
      title: 'New Release',
      version: '1.0.0',
      release_type: 'major'
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {releases?.results.map(release => (
        <div key={release.slug}>{release.title}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```
