This file serves as the main export barrel for all React hooks used throughout the application, providing a centralized access point for UI interactions, state management, API calls, and real-time messaging functionality.

## Key Components

### Core Hook Categories
- **UI Hooks** - Interface and user interaction utilities
- **Platform Hooks** - Platform-specific functionality and integrations
- **Toast System** - Notification and alert management
- **Contact Submission** - Form handling for user contact flows
- **Quick Action Hints** - User guidance and tooltip system
- **API Stubs** - Mock or development API interfaces

### Specialized Features
- **Image Authentication** - Secure image loading and batch processing hooks
- **URL State Management** - Browser state synchronization utilities
- **Product Releases API** - Hooks for fetching and managing product version data
- **NATS Client** - Real-time messaging and event streaming integration

## Usage Example

```typescript
import {
  useToast,
  useContactSubmission,
  useAuthenticatedImage,
  useProductReleases,
  useNatsClient
} from './hooks'

function MyComponent() {
  const { showToast } = useToast()
  const { submitContact, isLoading } = useContactSubmission()
  const { imageUrl, isAuthenticated } = useAuthenticatedImage('/api/secure-image')
  const { releases, refetch } = useProductReleases()
  const { client, isConnected } = useNatsClient()

  // Use hooks for various application features
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

This barrel export pattern enables clean imports and maintains a single source of truth for all hook dependencies across the application.
