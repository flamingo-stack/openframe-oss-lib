A Spring-based scheduler that monitors Debezium connectors and automatically restarts failed tasks using distributed locking to prevent concurrent executions across multiple instances.

## Key Components

- **DebeziumHealthCheckScheduler**: Main scheduler component with distributed locking capabilities
- **@Scheduled annotation**: Configures periodic health checks with customizable intervals
- **@SchedulerLock**: Ensures only one instance performs health checks in clustered environments
- **@ConditionalOnProperty**: Allows enabling/disabling the scheduler via configuration
- **DebeziumService dependency**: Service layer for actual health check operations

## Usage Example

```java
// Configuration properties (application.yml)
openframe:
  debezium:
    health-check:
      enabled: true
      interval: 300000  # 5 minutes
      lock-at-most-for: 5m
      lock-at-least-for: 1m

// The scheduler runs automatically when enabled
@Component
public class MyService {
    
    // Scheduler will automatically check Debezium health every 5 minutes
    // Only one instance will execute in clustered deployments
    // Failed connectors will be automatically restarted
}
```

The scheduler uses ShedLock to prevent multiple application instances from running health checks simultaneously. It's conditionally activated based on configuration and runs at configurable intervals (default 5 minutes) to monitor and restart failed Debezium connector tasks.
