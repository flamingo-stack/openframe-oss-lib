A Spring Boot scheduler component that automatically synchronizes API key statistics from Redis to MongoDB at configurable intervals with distributed locking support.

## Key Components

- **`syncStatsToMongo()`** - Main scheduled method that triggers the synchronization process with ShedLock distributed locking
- **`ApiKeyStatsSyncService`** - Injected service that handles the actual data synchronization logic
- **`@ConditionalOnProperty`** - Enables/disables the scheduler based on configuration property
- **`@SchedulerLock`** - Provides distributed locking to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously

## Usage Example

Configure in `application.yml`:
```yaml
openframe:
  api-key-stats:
    enabled: true
    sync-interval: 300000  # 5 minutes
    lock-at-most-for: 10m
    lock-at-least-for: 1m
```

The scheduler will automatically start when the application boots (if enabled) and run the sync operation at the specified interval. The distributed locking ensures that in a multi-instance deployment, only one instance performs the sync at a time, preventing data conflicts and duplicate processing.

```java
// The scheduler runs automatically - no manual invocation needed
// Logs will show sync start/completion or any errors
```
