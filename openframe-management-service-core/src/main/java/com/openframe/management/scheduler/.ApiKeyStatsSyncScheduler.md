A Spring-managed scheduler that periodically synchronizes API key statistics from Redis to MongoDB using distributed locking to prevent concurrent execution across multiple instances.

## Key Components

- **@Scheduled Method**: `syncStatsToMongo()` - Executes at configurable intervals to trigger the sync process
- **@SchedulerLock**: Prevents multiple instances from running the sync simultaneously using ShedLock
- **Conditional Activation**: Only active when `openframe.api-key-stats.enabled=true`
- **ApiKeyStatsSyncService**: Injected dependency that performs the actual data synchronization

## Usage Example

Configure the scheduler in your `application.yml`:

```yaml
openframe:
  api-key-stats:
    enabled: true
    sync-interval: 300000  # 5 minutes in milliseconds
    lock-at-most-for: 10m  # Maximum lock duration
    lock-at-least-for: 1m  # Minimum lock duration
```

The scheduler automatically starts when the application boots and logs its initialization:

```java
// The scheduler runs automatically - no manual intervention needed
// Logs will show:
// "ApiKeyStatsSyncScheduler initialized with distributed locking"
// "Starting scheduled Redis to MongoDB sync"
// "Completed scheduled Redis to MongoDB sync successfully"
```

This ensures API key usage statistics are regularly persisted from the fast Redis cache to the durable MongoDB storage, with proper error handling and distributed coordination across multiple application instances.
