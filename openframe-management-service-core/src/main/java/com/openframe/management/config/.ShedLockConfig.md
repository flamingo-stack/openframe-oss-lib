Configuration class that sets up ShedLock distributed locking mechanism using Redis as the lock provider to prevent duplicate execution of scheduled tasks across multiple application instances.

## Key Components

- **@EnableSchedulerLock** - Enables ShedLock with a default lock timeout of 10 minutes
- **@EnableScheduling** - Activates Spring's scheduling capabilities
- **lockProvider()** - Creates a Redis-based lock provider for distributed synchronization

## Usage Example

```java
@Component
public class ScheduledTaskService {
    
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 60000) // Run every minute
    @SchedulerLock(name = "processData", 
                   lockAtMostFor = "5m", 
                   lockAtLeastFor = "1m")
    public void processData() {
        // This method will only execute on one instance
        // even if multiple app instances are running
        System.out.println("Processing data...");
    }
    
    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * * ?") // Daily at 2 AM
    @SchedulerLock(name = "dailyCleanup")
    public void dailyCleanup() {
        // Cleanup task protected by distributed lock
        System.out.println("Running daily cleanup...");
    }
}
```

The configuration ensures that scheduled methods annotated with `@SchedulerLock` will only execute on one application instance at a time, preventing duplicate processing in distributed deployments.
