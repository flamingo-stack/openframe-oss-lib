Service responsible for managing agent registration secrets, including initial secret generation and encryption handling for secure agent onboarding.

## Key Components

- **createInitialSecret()** - Generates and stores the initial encrypted registration secret if none exists
- **AgentRegistrationSecretRepository** - Repository for persisting agent registration secrets
- **AgentRegistrationSecretGenerator** - Generates new secret keys
- **EncryptionService** - Handles encryption of sensitive secret data

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private AgentRegistrationSecretManagementService secretService;

// Initialize agent registration secrets during application startup
@PostConstruct
public void initializeSecrets() {
    secretService.createInitialSecret();
}
```

The service ensures only one initial secret is created by checking if any secrets already exist before generation. All secrets are encrypted before storage and marked as active with a creation timestamp. This provides a secure foundation for agent registration workflows while preventing duplicate secret creation during application restarts.
