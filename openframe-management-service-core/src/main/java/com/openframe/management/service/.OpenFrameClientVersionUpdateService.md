A Spring service component responsible for processing OpenFrame client version updates and coordinating release notifications to connected clients.

## Key Components

- **OpenFrameClientVersionUpdateService** - Main service class annotated with `@Component` for Spring dependency injection
- **OpenFrameClientUpdatePublisher** - Injected dependency for publishing update notifications to clients
- **process()** - Public method that accepts a new release version string (currently empty implementation)

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private OpenFrameClientVersionUpdateService versionUpdateService;

public void handleNewRelease() {
    String newVersion = "1.2.3";
    versionUpdateService.process(newVersion);
}
```

The service uses constructor injection via Lombok's `@RequiredArgsConstructor` annotation to inject the `OpenFrameClientUpdatePublisher`. This follows the dependency inversion principle by depending on the publisher abstraction rather than concrete implementations. The `process` method is designed to handle version update workflows, likely triggering notifications to all connected OpenFrame clients when a new release becomes available.
