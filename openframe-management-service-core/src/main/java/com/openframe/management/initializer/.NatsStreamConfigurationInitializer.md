A Spring component that automatically initializes NATS JetStream configurations for OpenFrame management operations during application startup. It defines multiple streams for handling tool installation, client updates, tool updates, connections, and agent management across machines.

## Key Components

- **CONFIGURATIONS** - Static list containing five pre-configured NATS streams:
  - `TOOL_INSTALLATION` - Handles tool installation events on machines
  - `CLIENT_UPDATE` - Manages client update notifications
  - `TOOL_UPDATE` - Processes tool agent updates
  - `TOOL_CONNECTIONS` - Tracks tool connection status
  - `INSTALLED_AGENTS` - Manages installed agent information
- **NatsStreamManagementService** - Injected service for stream operations
- **run()** - PostConstruct method that creates all streams on startup

## Usage Example

```java
// This component runs automatically at startup, but you can inject it for manual initialization:
@Autowired
private NatsStreamConfigurationInitializer initializer;

// Manually trigger initialization (though @PostConstruct handles this)
initializer.run();

// Stream configurations are created with these patterns:
// - Subject: "machine.{machineId}.tool-installation"
// - Storage: File-based with retention limits
// - All streams use consistent configuration patterns
```

The initializer ensures all required NATS streams exist before the application begins processing management events, with each stream configured for file storage and limit-based retention policies.
