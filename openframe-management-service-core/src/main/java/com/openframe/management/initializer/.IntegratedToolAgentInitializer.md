Initializes and manages IntegratedToolAgent configurations from classpath resources during application startup. This component loads agent configurations from JSON files, handles version management for release agents, and publishes update events when versions change.

## Key Components

- **`initializeToolAgents()`** - Main initialization method annotated with `@PostConstruct` that processes all configured agent files
- **`processAgentConfiguration(String)`** - Loads and parses individual agent configuration files from classpath resources
- **`processExistingAgent()`** - Handles updates to existing agents while preserving versions for release agents
- **`processNewAgent()`** - Creates new agent configurations in the system
- **`processVersionUpdate()`** - Detects version changes and publishes update events for non-release agents

## Usage Example

The initializer automatically runs at application startup and requires configuration properties:

```java
// Configuration in application.yml
agent:
  configurations:
    - "agents/tool-agent-1.json"
    - "agents/tool-agent-2.json"

// Agent configuration JSON structure
{
  "id": "example-agent",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "releaseVersion": false,
  "name": "Example Tool Agent",
  "description": "Sample agent configuration"
}
```

The component handles both new agent creation and updates to existing agents, with special logic to preserve versions for release agents and publish update events when versions change for development agents.
