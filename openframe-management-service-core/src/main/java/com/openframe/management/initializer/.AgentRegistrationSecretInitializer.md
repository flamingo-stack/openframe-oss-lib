A Spring Boot application runner that automatically initializes the agent registration secret when the application starts up. This component ensures that the necessary security credentials for agent registration are available before the application begins processing requests.

## Key Components

- **AgentRegistrationSecretInitializer**: Main component implementing `ApplicationRunner`
- **agentRegistrationSecretService**: Injected service for managing registration secrets
- **run()**: Lifecycle method that executes the secret initialization process

## Usage Example

This component runs automatically during application startup, but here's how it integrates with the Spring Boot lifecycle:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class ManagementApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // AgentRegistrationSecretInitializer will run automatically
        SpringApplication.run(ManagementApplication.class, args);
    }
}

// The initializer depends on this service
@Service
public class AgentRegistrationSecretManagementService {
    public void createInitialSecret() {
        // Implementation for creating/validating registration secrets
    }
}
```

The component uses `@Order` annotation capability to control execution sequence relative to other `ApplicationRunner` implementations, ensuring proper initialization order during startup.
