Interface for processing user operation lifecycle events in the API service layer. Provides hooks for post-processing actions after user operations complete, with future extensibility for event publishing to Kafka.

## Key Components

- **`postProcessUserDeleted(User user)`** - Processes events after a user has been soft deleted with DELETED status
- **`postProcessUserGet(UserPageResponse response)`** - Processes events after user retrieval operations

## Usage Example

```java
@Component
public class UserProcessorImpl implements UserProcessor {
    
    private final EventPublisher eventPublisher;
    
    @Override
    public void postProcessUserDeleted(User user) {
        // Log the deletion
        log.info("User {} has been soft deleted", user.getId());
        
        // Future: Publish to Kafka
        // eventPublisher.publishUserDeleted(user);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void postProcessUserGet(UserPageResponse response) {
        // Track user access metrics
        log.debug("User data retrieved: {} records", response.getTotalElements());
        
        // Future: Publish analytics event
        // eventPublisher.publishUserAccessed(response);
    }
}
```

The interface follows a post-processing pattern, allowing implementations to perform side effects like logging, metrics collection, or event publishing without blocking the main operation flow.
