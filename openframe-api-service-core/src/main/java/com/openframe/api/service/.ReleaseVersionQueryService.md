Service class responsible for querying release version information from the database. Provides methods to retrieve the current release version using repository pattern.

## Key Components

- **ReleaseVersionQueryService**: Main service class annotated with `@Service` for Spring dependency injection
- **getReleaseVersion()**: Returns the earliest created release version as an Optional
- **ReleaseVersionRepository**: Injected repository dependency for database operations
- **ReleaseVersion**: Document entity representing version information

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private ReleaseVersionQueryService versionQueryService;

public void checkCurrentVersion() {
    Optional<ReleaseVersion> version = versionQueryService.getReleaseVersion();
    
    if (version.isPresent()) {
        ReleaseVersion currentVersion = version.get();
        log.info("Current release version: {}", currentVersion);
    } else {
        log.warn("No release version found in database");
    }
}
```

The service uses constructor injection via Lombok's `@RequiredArgsConstructor` and includes debug logging. The query method retrieves the first release version ordered by creation date ascending, making it suitable for getting the initial or baseline version.
