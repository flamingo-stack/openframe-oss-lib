A custom runtime exception thrown when a requested operation cannot be performed due to business rules or system constraints.

## Key Components

- **OperationNotAllowedException** - Runtime exception class that extends `RuntimeException`
- **Constructor** - Accepts a descriptive error message to explain why the operation was denied

## Usage Example

```java
// Throwing the exception when a user tries to delete a resource they don't own
public void deletePost(Long postId, Long userId) {
    Post post = postRepository.findById(postId);
    if (!post.getOwnerId().equals(userId)) {
        throw new OperationNotAllowedException(
            "User " + userId + " is not authorized to delete post " + postId
        );
    }
    postRepository.delete(post);
}

// Catching and handling the exception
try {
    postService.deletePost(123L, 456L);
} catch (OperationNotAllowedException e) {
    logger.warn("Operation denied: {}", e.getMessage());
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
        .body(new ErrorResponse(e.getMessage()));
}
```

This exception is typically used in service layers to enforce business logic and prevent unauthorized or invalid operations from proceeding.
