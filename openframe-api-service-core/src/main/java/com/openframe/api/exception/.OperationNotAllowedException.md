A custom runtime exception class used to signal when a requested operation cannot be performed due to business logic constraints or security restrictions.

## Key Components

- **OperationNotAllowedException** - Runtime exception class that extends `RuntimeException`
- **Constructor** - Single constructor accepting a descriptive error message

## Usage Example

```java
// Throwing when user lacks permissions
if (!user.hasPermission(Permission.DELETE)) {
    throw new OperationNotAllowedException("User does not have permission to delete this resource");
}

// Throwing when operation violates business rules
if (account.getBalance() < withdrawAmount) {
    throw new OperationNotAllowedException("Insufficient funds for withdrawal operation");
}

// Catching and handling the exception
try {
    service.performOperation();
} catch (OperationNotAllowedException e) {
    logger.warn("Operation blocked: " + e.getMessage());
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
        .body(new ErrorResponse(e.getMessage()));
}
```

This exception is typically used in service layers to enforce business rules and security policies. Since it extends `RuntimeException`, it's unchecked and doesn't require explicit exception handling, making it suitable for validation scenarios where the caller should handle the constraint violation appropriately.
