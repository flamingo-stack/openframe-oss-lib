A custom runtime exception thrown when a user attempts to delete their own account, which is not permitted by the system's business rules.

## Key Components

- **UserSelfDeleteNotAllowedException** - Custom runtime exception class that extends `RuntimeException`
- **Constructor** - Takes a string message parameter to provide context about the failed deletion attempt

## Usage Example

```java
// In a user service class
public void deleteUser(Long userId, Long currentUserId) {
    if (userId.equals(currentUserId)) {
        throw new UserSelfDeleteNotAllowedException(
            "Users cannot delete their own account"
        );
    }
    // Proceed with deletion logic
    userRepository.deleteById(userId);
}

// Exception handling in a controller
@ExceptionHandler(UserSelfDeleteNotAllowedException.class)
public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleSelfDeleteException(
    UserSelfDeleteNotAllowedException ex) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
        .body(new ErrorResponse(ex.getMessage()));
}
```

This exception is typically thrown in user management services where administrators can delete user accounts, but users are prevented from deleting themselves to maintain system integrity and prevent accidental self-removal.
