A custom runtime exception thrown when a user attempts to delete their own account, which is not permitted by the system's business rules.

## Key Components

- **UserSelfDeleteNotAllowedException** - Runtime exception class that extends `RuntimeException`
- **Constructor** - Accepts a custom error message to provide context about the failed operation

## Usage Example

```java
// In a user service class
public void deleteUser(Long userId, Long currentUserId) {
    if (userId.equals(currentUserId)) {
        throw new UserSelfDeleteNotAllowedException(
            "Users cannot delete their own account"
        );
    }
    // Proceed with deletion logic
    userRepository.deleteById(userId);
}

// Exception handling
try {
    userService.deleteUser(123L, 123L);
} catch (UserSelfDeleteNotAllowedException e) {
    logger.warn("Self-deletion attempted: {}", e.getMessage());
    return ResponseEntity.badRequest()
        .body("Cannot delete your own account");
}
```

This exception enforces the business rule that prevents users from deleting themselves, typically used in administrative interfaces where users can manage other accounts but must be prevented from accidentally removing their own access.
