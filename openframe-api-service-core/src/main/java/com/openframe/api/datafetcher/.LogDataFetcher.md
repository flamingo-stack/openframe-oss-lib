<!-- source-hash: 42d0705587193a8eff2e25b2082f6bae -->
A GraphQL Data Fetcher component that provides query endpoints for retrieving and filtering log data with pagination support. This class acts as the GraphQL API layer for log operations using Netflix DGS framework.

## Key Components

- **`logFilters`** - GraphQL query for retrieving available filter options based on filter criteria
- **`logs`** - Main GraphQL query for fetching paginated log events with filtering and search capabilities
- **`logDetails`** - GraphQL query for retrieving detailed information about a specific log event
- **LogService** - Service layer dependency for log business logic
- **GraphQLLogMapper** - Mapper for converting between GraphQL DTOs and service objects

## Usage Example

```java
// GraphQL query for logs with filters and pagination
query GetLogs($filter: LogFilterInput, $pagination: CursorPaginationInput, $search: String) {
  logs(filter: $filter, pagination: $pagination, search: $search) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        timestamp
        toolType
        eventType
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}

// GraphQL query for specific log details
query GetLogDetails($ingestDay: String!, $toolType: String!, $eventType: String!, 
                   $timestamp: Instant!, $toolEventId: String!) {
  logDetails(ingestDay: $ingestDay, toolType: $toolType, eventType: $eventType,
            timestamp: $timestamp, toolEventId: $toolEventId) {
    id
    details
    metadata
  }
}
```

The component uses cursor-based pagination for efficient large dataset handling and includes comprehensive validation and logging for monitoring query performance.
