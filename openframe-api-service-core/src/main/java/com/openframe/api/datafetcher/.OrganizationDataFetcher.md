A GraphQL data fetcher component that handles organization-related queries in the OpenFrame platform, providing endpoints for retrieving organizations with filtering, pagination, and search capabilities.

## Key Components

**Main Class:**
- `OrganizationDataFetcher` - DGS-annotated component for GraphQL organization queries

**Dependencies:**
- `OrganizationService` - Core organization business logic service
- `OrganizationQueryService` - Specialized query operations with advanced filtering
- `GraphQLOrganizationMapper` - Maps between DTOs and domain objects

**GraphQL Query Methods:**
- `organizations()` - Returns paginated, filtered list of organizations with connection wrapper
- `organization()` - Fetches single organization by internal ID
- `organizationByOrganizationId()` - Fetches organization by business identifier

## Usage Example

```java
// GraphQL query for paginated organizations with filtering
query {
  organizations(
    filter: { status: ACTIVE, type: MSP },
    pagination: { first: 10, after: "cursor123" },
    search: "flamingo",
    sort: { field: "name", direction: ASC }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        organizationId
        name
        status
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
    totalCount
  }
}

// Fetch specific organization
query {
  organization(id: "org-123") {
    name
    organizationId
    createdAt
  }
}
```

The component uses Netflix DGS framework annotations and includes comprehensive validation, logging, and error handling for robust GraphQL API operations.
