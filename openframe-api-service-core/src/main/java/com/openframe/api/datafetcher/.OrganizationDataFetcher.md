A GraphQL data fetcher component that handles organization-related queries using Netflix DGS framework, providing both paginated list queries and individual organization lookups.

## Key Components

- **`@DgsComponent`** - Netflix DGS GraphQL component annotation
- **`organizations()`** - Paginated query with filtering and search capabilities
- **`organization()`** - Single organization lookup by internal ID
- **`organizationByOrganizationId()`** - Single organization lookup by business organization ID
- **OrganizationService** - Core organization data access service
- **OrganizationQueryService** - Advanced querying with filtering and pagination
- **GraphQLOrganizationMapper** - Maps between DTOs and domain objects

## Usage Example

This data fetcher automatically handles GraphQL queries through the DGS framework:

```java
// GraphQL queries this component handles:

// Paginated organizations with filtering
query {
  organizations(
    filter: { status: ACTIVE, type: ENTERPRISE }
    pagination: { first: 10, after: "cursor123" }
    search: "tech company"
  ) {
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        organizationId
      }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}

// Single organization by internal ID
query {
  organization(id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011") {
    id
    name
    organizationId
  }
}

// Single organization by business ID
query {
  organizationByOrganizationId(organizationId: "ORG-12345") {
    id
    name
    organizationId
  }
}
```

The component uses Spring validation annotations to ensure input parameters meet requirements and includes comprehensive logging for debugging GraphQL operations.
