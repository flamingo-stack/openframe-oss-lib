This GraphQL data fetcher provides comprehensive device query capabilities and resolves related entity relationships using Netflix DGS framework.

## Key Components

**Query Resolvers:**
- `deviceFilters()` - Returns available filter options for device queries
- `devices()` - Fetches paginated device list with filtering and search
- `device()` - Retrieves single device by machine ID

**Field Resolvers:**
- `tags()` - Resolves device tags using DataLoader
- `toolConnections()` - Resolves tool connections for devices
- `installedAgents()` - Resolves installed agents on devices
- `organization()` - Resolves organization relationship

**Dependencies:**
- `DeviceService` - Core device business logic
- `DeviceFilterService` - Device filtering operations
- `GraphQLDeviceMapper` - DTO mapping utilities

## Usage Example

```java
// GraphQL query examples this fetcher supports:

// Get filtered devices with pagination
query GetDevices($filter: DeviceFilterInput, $pagination: CursorPaginationInput) {
  devices(filter: $filter, pagination: $pagination) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        machineId
        tags { name }
        organization { name }
      }
    }
    totalCount
  }
}

// Get single device with related data
query GetDevice($id: String!) {
  device(machineId: $id) {
    id
    machineId
    installedAgents { name }
    toolConnections { status }
  }
}
```
