<!-- source-hash: 3ae82b5e5c69d690d4ed3a06ac50bd66 -->
This enum defines the possible states of an invitation in the OpenFrame API system, providing a standardized way to track invitation lifecycle status.

## Key Components

- **PENDING** - Invitation has been sent but not yet responded to
- **ACCEPTED** - Invitation has been accepted by the recipient  
- **EXPIRED** - Invitation has passed its expiration date/time
- **REVOKED** - Invitation has been cancelled by the sender

## Usage Example

```java
// Setting invitation status
invitation.setStatus(InvitationStatus.PENDING);

// Checking invitation status
if (invitation.getStatus() == InvitationStatus.ACCEPTED) {
    // Process accepted invitation
    processAcceptedInvitation(invitation);
}

// Status transition logic
switch (invitation.getStatus()) {
    case PENDING:
        // Allow acceptance or expiration
        break;
    case ACCEPTED:
        // Invitation completed successfully
        break;
    case EXPIRED:
    case REVOKED:
        // Invitation no longer valid
        break;
}
```

This enum is typically used in invitation DTOs and services to manage the state machine of invitation workflows, ensuring consistent status tracking across the application.
