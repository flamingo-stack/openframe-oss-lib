A GraphQL input DTO class that defines filtering criteria for organization queries, providing structured parameters for searching and filtering organizations by various attributes.

## Key Components

- **category** - String filter for organization category/type
- **minEmployees** - Integer filter for minimum employee count threshold
- **maxEmployees** - Integer filter for maximum employee count threshold  
- **hasActiveContract** - Boolean filter to include/exclude organizations with active contracts
- **@Data** - Lombok annotation providing getters, setters, toString, equals, and hashCode methods

## Usage Example

```java
// Create filter for tech companies with 50-500 employees and active contracts
OrganizationFilterInput filter = new OrganizationFilterInput();
filter.setCategory("Technology");
filter.setMinEmployees(50);
filter.setMaxEmployees(500);
filter.setHasActiveContract(true);

// Use in GraphQL query service
List<Organization> results = organizationService.findOrganizations(filter);

// Filter for any size organizations in healthcare without contract requirement
OrganizationFilterInput healthcareFilter = new OrganizationFilterInput();
healthcareFilter.setCategory("Healthcare");
// Leave employee counts and contract status null for no filtering on those criteria
```
