A data transfer object (DTO) record that represents a release version response in the OpenFrame API, containing version metadata and timestamps.

## Key Components

- **ReleaseVersionResponse** - Immutable record class with the following fields:
  - `id` - Unique identifier for the release version
  - `releaseVersion` - The actual version string/number
  - `createdAt` - Timestamp when the version was created
  - `updatedAt` - Timestamp when the version was last modified

## Usage Example

```java
// Creating a new release version response
ReleaseVersionResponse response = new ReleaseVersionResponse(
    "uuid-123",
    "v1.2.3",
    Instant.now(),
    Instant.now()
);

// Accessing record fields
String version = response.releaseVersion();
Instant created = response.createdAt();

// Typical usage in API controllers
@GetMapping("/releases/{id}")
public ReleaseVersionResponse getReleaseVersion(@PathVariable String id) {
    // Service layer would populate this record
    return new ReleaseVersionResponse(
        id,
        releaseService.getVersion(id),
        releaseService.getCreatedAt(id),
        releaseService.getUpdatedAt(id)
    );
}
```
