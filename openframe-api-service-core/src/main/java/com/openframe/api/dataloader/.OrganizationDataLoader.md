A GraphQL DataLoader implementation that efficiently batch loads Organization entities by their IDs, preventing N+1 query problems when resolving organization data for multiple machines or other related entities.

## Key Components

- **`@DgsDataLoader`** - Netflix DGS annotation that registers this as a DataLoader bean named "organizationDataLoader"
- **`BatchLoader<String, Organization>`** - Interface implementation for batch loading organizations by string IDs
- **`OrganizationRepository`** - Injected repository for database operations
- **`load()`** - Main batch loading method that handles null filtering, deduplication, and order preservation

## Usage Example

This DataLoader is automatically used by the DGS framework when resolving organization fields:

```java
// In a GraphQL resolver
@DgsComponent
public class MachineDataFetcher {
    
    @DgsData(parentType = "Machine", field = "organization")
    public CompletableFuture<Organization> organization(
            DgsDataFetchingEnvironment dfe) {
        
        Machine machine = dfe.getSource();
        DataLoader<String, Organization> loader = 
            dfe.getDataLoader("organizationDataLoader");
            
        return loader.load(machine.getOrganizationId());
    }
}

// Multiple machines will batch their organization lookups
// instead of executing separate queries for each machine
```

The DataLoader automatically batches organization ID requests, filters out null values and soft-deleted organizations, and returns results in the same order as the input IDs to maintain GraphQL resolution consistency.
