REST controller that handles HTTP requests for retrieving the current release version information. Uses a query service to fetch version data and returns it as a standardized response.

## Key Components

- **ReleaseVersionController** - Main REST controller class
- **getReleaseVersion()** - GET endpoint that retrieves the current release version
- **ReleaseVersionQueryService** - Injected service for version data queries
- **ReleaseVersionResponse** - DTO for structured version response

## Usage Example

The controller exposes a single GET endpoint that can be accessed via HTTP:

```java
// HTTP GET request to retrieve version info
GET /release-version

// Successful response (200 OK):
{
  "id": 1,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
}

// No version found (404 NOT FOUND):
// Empty response body with 404 status
```

The endpoint uses functional-style programming with Optional handling - if a version is found, it returns a 200 OK response with version details, otherwise returns a 404 NOT FOUND status. All requests are logged for monitoring purposes.
