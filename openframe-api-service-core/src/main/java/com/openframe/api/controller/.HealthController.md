A Spring Boot REST controller that provides a basic health check endpoint for application monitoring and load balancer status verification.

## Key Components

- **HealthController**: Main REST controller class annotated with `@RestController`
- **health()**: GET endpoint method that returns application health status
- **Logger**: SLF4J logger for tracking health check requests

## Usage Example

The health endpoint is automatically available once the application starts:

```java
// The controller exposes a GET endpoint at /health
// Example HTTP request:
GET /health HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080

// Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 2

OK
```

This endpoint is commonly used by:
- Load balancers for health checks
- Monitoring systems like Kubernetes liveness probes
- Service discovery mechanisms

```java
// In a monitoring configuration:
@Configuration
public class MonitoringConfig {
    // Point health checks to /health endpoint
    private static final String HEALTH_URL = "/health";
}
```
