REST API controller that manages user operations including listing, retrieving, updating, and deleting users. Provides paginated user listing and handles authentication for secure operations.

## Key Components

- **`listUsers(page, size)`** - Returns paginated list of users with configurable page size (default 20)
- **`getUserById(id)`** - Retrieves a specific user by ID with NOT_FOUND error handling
- **`updateUserById(id, request)`** - Updates user data with validation and error handling
- **`deleteUser(id, principal)`** - Performs soft delete operation with authenticated user tracking

## Usage Example

```java
// List users with pagination
GET /users?page=0&size=10

// Get specific user
GET /users/user-123

// Update user data
PUT /users/user-123
{
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "email": "newemail@example.com"
}

// Delete user (requires authentication)
DELETE /users/user-123
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The controller uses Spring Security's `@AuthenticationPrincipal` for authenticated operations and implements proper HTTP status codes with exception handling for invalid requests.
