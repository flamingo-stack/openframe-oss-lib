REST controller that handles user management operations including listing and deletion of users.

## Key Components

- **`listUsers()`** - GET endpoint that retrieves paginated user data with configurable page size and offset
- **`deleteUser()`** - DELETE endpoint that performs soft deletion of users by ID with authentication
- **UserService** - Injected service dependency for business logic operations
- **AuthPrincipal** - Security principal for accessing authenticated user information

## Usage Example

```java
// GET /users - List users with default pagination
// Returns: UserPageResponse with page=0, size=20

// GET /users?page=1&size=10 - List users with custom pagination
// Returns: UserPageResponse with page=1, size=10

// DELETE /users/123 - Delete user by ID
// Requires: Authentication header
// Returns: HTTP 204 No Content

// Example service integration
@Autowired
private UserService userService;

UserPageResponse users = userService.listUsers(0, 10);
userService.softDeleteUser("user123", authenticatedUserId);
```

The controller uses Spring Security for authentication and follows REST conventions with appropriate HTTP status codes. All operations are delegated to the UserService layer for business logic processing.
