REST controller for organization management operations (create, update, delete) in the OpenFrame API. Handles command operations while delegating read operations to the external API for public access.

## Key Components

- **OrganizationController** - Main REST controller class with `/organizations` base mapping
- **createOrganization()** - POST endpoint for creating new organizations
- **updateOrganization()** - PUT endpoint for updating existing organizations  
- **deleteOrganization()** - DELETE endpoint for removing organizations
- **OrganizationCommandService** - Service dependency for business logic
- **OrganizationMapper** - Mapper for converting entities to response DTOs

## Usage Example

```java
// POST /organizations - Create organization
@PostMapping
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
public OrganizationResponse createOrganization(@Valid @RequestBody CreateOrganizationRequest request) {
    var created = organizationCommandService.createOrganization(request);
    return organizationMapper.toResponse(created);
}

// PUT /organizations/{id} - Update organization
@PutMapping("/{id}")
public OrganizationResponse updateOrganization(
        @PathVariable String id,
        @Valid @RequestBody UpdateOrganizationRequest request) {
    try {
        var updated = organizationCommandService.updateOrganization(id, request);
        return organizationMapper.toResponse(updated);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

The controller implements proper HTTP status codes (201 for creation, 409 for conflicts) and exception handling for business rule violations like attempting to delete organizations with associated machines.
