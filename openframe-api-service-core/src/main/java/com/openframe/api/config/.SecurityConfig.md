Spring Security configuration that provides minimal security setup with JWT issuer caching for OAuth2 resource server functionality. This configuration is designed to work behind a gateway that handles the primary authentication and authorization logic.

## Key Components

- **`jwtProviderCache()`** - Caffeine-based cache for JWT authentication providers, configured with expiration and refresh policies
- **`securityFilterChain()`** - Main security configuration that permits all requests and sets up OAuth2 resource server with multi-issuer support
- **`JwtIssuerAuthenticationManagerResolver`** - Resolves authentication managers based on JWT issuer using the cached providers

## Usage Example

```java
// Configuration properties (application.yml)
openframe:
  security:
    jwt:
      cache:
        expire-after: PT1H
        refresh-after: PT30M
        maximum-size: 100

// The security filter chain automatically handles JWT validation
// Controllers can access authentication principal:
@RestController
public class ExampleController {
    
    @GetMapping("/user-info")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getUserInfo(@AuthenticationPrincipal JwtAuthenticationToken jwt) {
        String subject = jwt.getToken().getSubject();
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User: " + subject);
    }
}
```

The configuration assumes a gateway handles JWT validation and filtering, while this service only needs OAuth2 resource server capabilities for `@AuthenticationPrincipal` support. All requests are permitted at this level since authorization is handled upstream.
