REST controller that proxies HTTP requests to external integrated tools through a unified API gateway.

## Key Components

- **IntegrationController**: Main controller class handling tool integration requests
- **proxyApiRequest()**: Method that forwards HTTP requests to specified tools
- **RestProxyService**: Injected service that handles the actual proxying logic
- **Request mapping**: Catches all HTTP methods on `/tools/{toolId}/**` paths

## Usage Example

```java
// Example API calls through the proxy

// GET request to a tool
GET /tools/github/repos/owner/repo

// POST request with body
POST /tools/jira/issue
Content-Type: application/json
X-User-Id: user123
X-API-Key-Id: key456

{
  "summary": "New issue",
  "description": "Issue description"
}

// PUT request to update resource
PUT /tools/confluence/pages/123
{
  "title": "Updated Page Title"
}
```

The controller automatically extracts the tool ID from the URL path and forwards the complete request (including headers, body, and query parameters) to the appropriate external service. All standard HTTP methods are supported, and the service handles authentication through `X-User-Id` and `X-API-Key-Id` headers.
