A Spring service that acts as a REST API proxy, forwarding HTTP requests to external integrated tools while handling authentication and URL resolution.

## Key Components

- **`proxyApiRequest()`** - Main entry point that validates tools, resolves target URIs, and proxies requests
- **`buildApiRequestHeaders()`** - Constructs HTTP headers with authentication (API key, Bearer token, or none)
- **`proxy()`** - Executes the actual HTTP request to the target service and returns the response
- **`createHttpRequest()`** - Factory method for creating Apache HTTP client request objects
- **`createHttpClient()`** - Configures HTTP client with timeouts and connection settings

## Usage Example

```java
@RestController
public class ProxyController {
    
    @Autowired
    private RestProxyService restProxyService;
    
    @RequestMapping("/tools/{toolId}/**")
    public ResponseEntity<String> proxyToTool(
            @PathVariable String toolId,
            HttpServletRequest request,
            @RequestBody(required = false) String body) {
        
        return restProxyService.proxyApiRequest(toolId, request, body);
    }
}
```

The service automatically handles authentication based on tool configuration, supports all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), and includes comprehensive error handling and logging. It resolves proxy URLs through the `ProxyUrlResolver` and manages tool credentials for seamless API integration.
