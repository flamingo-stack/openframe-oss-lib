A custom runtime exception thrown when an event cannot be found in the system, extending RuntimeException to indicate an unchecked exception that doesn't require explicit handling.

## Key Components

- **EventNotFoundException**: Custom exception class that extends RuntimeException
- **Constructor**: Single parameterized constructor accepting a descriptive error message

## Usage Example

```java
// Throwing the exception when an event is not found
public Event findEventById(String eventId) {
    Event event = eventRepository.findById(eventId);
    if (event == null) {
        throw new EventNotFoundException("Event with ID " + eventId + " not found");
    }
    return event;
}

// Catching the exception (optional since it's unchecked)
try {
    Event event = eventService.findEventById("invalid-id");
} catch (EventNotFoundException e) {
    logger.error("Event lookup failed: " + e.getMessage());
    // Handle the missing event scenario
}
```

This exception is typically used in service layers or repositories to signal that a requested event doesn't exist, allowing calling code to handle the missing event scenario appropriately.
