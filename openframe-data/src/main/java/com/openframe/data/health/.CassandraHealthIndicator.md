A Spring Boot health indicator that monitors the status of a Cassandra database connection by executing a simple query against the system tables.

## Key Components

- **CassandraHealthIndicator**: Main component implementing `HealthIndicator` interface
- **health()**: Core method that performs health check by querying Cassandra's `system.local` table
- **@ConditionalOnProperty**: Auto-configuration that enables the component only when Cassandra is configured
- **CassandraOperations**: Injected dependency for executing Cassandra operations

## Usage Example

This health indicator is automatically registered with Spring Boot Actuator when Cassandra is enabled:

```java
// Component is auto-configured when cassandra is enabled
// Access health status via actuator endpoint:
// GET /actuator/health

// Example response when Cassandra is healthy:
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "cassandra": {
      "status": "UP"
    }
  }
}

// Example response when Cassandra is down:
{
  "status": "DOWN",
  "components": {
    "cassandra": {
      "status": "DOWN",
      "details": {
        "error": "Connection refused"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The health check can be disabled by setting `spring.data.cassandra.enabled=false` in application properties.
