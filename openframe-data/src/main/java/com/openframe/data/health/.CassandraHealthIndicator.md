Spring Boot health indicator that monitors Cassandra database connectivity and availability for application health checks.

## Key Components

- **CassandraHealthIndicator** - Main health check component that implements Spring Boot's `HealthIndicator` interface
- **health()** - Core method that executes a lightweight query against Cassandra's system.local table to verify connectivity
- **@ConditionalOnProperty** - Conditional activation based on `spring.data.cassandra.enabled` configuration property

## Usage Example

The health indicator automatically integrates with Spring Boot Actuator endpoints when Cassandra is enabled:

```java
// Access health status via actuator endpoint
GET /actuator/health

// Response when Cassandra is healthy
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "cassandra": {
      "status": "UP"
    }
  }
}

// Response when Cassandra is down
{
  "status": "DOWN",
  "components": {
    "cassandra": {
      "status": "DOWN",
      "details": {
        "error": "connection timeout details..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The component performs a minimal query (`SELECT release_version FROM system.local`) to verify database connectivity without impacting performance. It's conditionally loaded only when Cassandra is enabled in the application configuration, making it suitable for microservices that may optionally use Cassandra.
