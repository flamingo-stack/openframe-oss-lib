A simple enumeration that defines the types of data enrichment services available in the OpenFrame system.

## Key Components

- **INTEGRATED_TOOLS_EVENTS** - Enum constant representing data enrichment through integrated tools events

## Usage Example

```java
// Using the enum in service configuration
DataEnrichmentServiceType serviceType = DataEnrichmentServiceType.INTEGRATED_TOOLS_EVENTS;

// In a switch statement
switch (enrichmentType) {
    case INTEGRATED_TOOLS_EVENTS:
        // Handle integrated tools events enrichment
        break;
}

// Comparison
if (service.getType() == DataEnrichmentServiceType.INTEGRATED_TOOLS_EVENTS) {
    // Process integrated tools events
}
```

This enum provides type safety for data enrichment service configurations and is likely used throughout the system to identify and route different types of enrichment processes.
