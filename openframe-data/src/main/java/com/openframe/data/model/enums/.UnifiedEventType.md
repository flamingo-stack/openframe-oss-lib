This enum defines a comprehensive set of event types for the OpenFrame system's unified event logging and monitoring. It categorizes all possible system events with associated severity levels and human-readable summaries.

## Key Components

- **Event Categories**: Authentication, device management, user management, scripts/automation, policies, file operations, remote access, monitoring, system events, and more
- **Severity Levels**: Each event has an associated `Severity` (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- **Summary Messages**: Human-readable descriptions for each event type
- **Lombok Integration**: Uses `@Getter` for automatic accessor methods

The enum covers over 100 different event types across major functional areas including device lifecycle, user operations, security events, compliance monitoring, and system administration.

## Usage Example

```java
// Creating an event with type and accessing its properties
UnifiedEventType eventType = UnifiedEventType.LOGIN_FAILED;
Severity severity = eventType.getSeverity(); // WARNING
String message = eventType.getSummary(); // "Failed login attempt"

// Using in event logging
public void logEvent(UnifiedEventType type, String details) {
    logger.log(type.getSeverity().getLevel(), 
               "{}: {}", type.getSummary(), details);
}

// Example usage
logEvent(UnifiedEventType.DEVICE_OFFLINE, "Device ID: 12345 went offline");
logEvent(UnifiedEventType.SCRIPT_FAILED, "Script execution failed due to timeout");
```
