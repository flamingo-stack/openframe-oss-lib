A data model class that represents client connection events in the NATS messaging system, containing timestamp information and client details.

## Key Components

- **ClientConnectionEvent** - Main event class with timestamp and client information
- **Client** - Nested static class representing client details with name property
- **Lombok annotations** - `@Getter` and `@Setter` for automatic property access methods

## Usage Example

```java
// Create a new client connection event
ClientConnectionEvent event = new ClientConnectionEvent();
event.setTimestamp("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z");

// Set client information
ClientConnectionEvent.Client client = new ClientConnectionEvent.Client();
client.setName("mobile-app-client");
event.setClient(client);

// Access the event data
String eventTime = event.getTimestamp();
String clientName = event.getClient().getName();
System.out.println("Client " + clientName + " connected at " + eventTime);
```

This class is typically used for tracking and logging client connection activities in NATS-based messaging systems, providing a structured way to capture when clients connect and their identifying information.
