Custom OAuth2 authorization request resolver that extracts pre-generated state parameters from signed cookies and injects them into outgoing authorization requests for SSO providers like Google and Microsoft.

## Key Components

- **SsoAuthorizationRequestResolver** - Main resolver class implementing `OAuth2AuthorizationRequestResolver`
- **resolve()** - Resolves authorization requests with or without specific client registration IDs
- **maybeInjectStateFromCookie()** - Conditionally injects state from cookie into OAuth2 request
- **extractStateFromCookie()** - Extracts state parameter from SSO registration or invite cookies

## Usage Example

```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public OAuth2AuthorizationRequestResolver authorizationRequestResolver(
            ClientRegistrationRepository clientRepo,
            SsoCookieCodec cookieCodec) {
        return new SsoAuthorizationRequestResolver(clientRepo, cookieCodec);
    }
    
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http,
                                         OAuth2AuthorizationRequestResolver resolver) {
        return http
            .oauth2Login(oauth2 -> oauth2
                .authorizationEndpoint(endpoint -> 
                    endpoint.authorizationRequestResolver(resolver)))
            .build();
    }
}
```

The resolver automatically reads state values from `COOKIE_SSO_REG` and `COOKIE_SSO_INVITE` cookies, validates them using the codec, and injects the state into OAuth2 authorization requests for seamless SSO flow continuation.
