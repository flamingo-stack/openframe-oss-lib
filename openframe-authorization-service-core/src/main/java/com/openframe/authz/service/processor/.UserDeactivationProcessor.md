An interface for handling post-processing operations after a user has been deactivated in the authorization system. This allows for implementing cleanup tasks, notifications, or other business logic that should occur following user deactivation.

## Key Components

- **`postProcessDeactivation(AuthUser existing)`** - Main processing method that receives the deactivated user record and performs any required post-deactivation operations

## Usage Example

```java
@Component
public class EmailNotificationDeactivationProcessor implements UserDeactivationProcessor {
    
    @Autowired
    private NotificationService notificationService;
    
    @Override
    public void postProcessDeactivation(AuthUser existing) {
        // Send deactivation notification
        notificationService.sendUserDeactivatedEmail(existing.getEmail());
        
        // Log the deactivation event
        log.info("User {} has been deactivated", existing.getUsername());
        
        // Clean up user sessions or tokens if needed
        cleanupUserSessions(existing.getId());
    }
    
    private void cleanupUserSessions(String userId) {
        // Implementation for session cleanup
    }
}
```

This interface follows the processor pattern to decouple user deactivation from its side effects, enabling multiple implementations for different post-processing requirements like audit logging, email notifications, or resource cleanup.
