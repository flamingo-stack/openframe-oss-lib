Shared mapper component for converting between organization DTOs and entities, handling both creation and update operations with automatic UUID generation for organization IDs.

## Key Components

- **`toEntity(CreateOrganizationRequest)`** - Converts create request to Organization entity with auto-generated UUID
- **`updateEntity(Organization, UpdateOrganizationRequest)`** - Performs partial updates on existing entities
- **`toResponse(Organization)`** - Converts entity to response DTO
- **Contact Information Mapping** - Nested mappers for ContactInformation, ContactPerson, and Address objects
- **`copyAddress(Address)`** - Creates address copies when mailing address matches physical address

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private OrganizationMapper organizationMapper;

// Create new organization
CreateOrganizationRequest createRequest = new CreateOrganizationRequest(
    "Acme Corp", "TECHNOLOGY", 100, "https://acme.com", null, null, 
    50000.0, LocalDate.now(), LocalDate.now().plusYears(1)
);
Organization newOrg = organizationMapper.toEntity(createRequest);

// Update existing organization (partial update)
UpdateOrganizationRequest updateRequest = UpdateOrganizationRequest.builder()
    .name("Acme Corporation")
    .numberOfEmployees(150)
    .build();
Organization updated = organizationMapper.updateEntity(existingOrg, updateRequest);

// Convert to response
OrganizationResponse response = organizationMapper.toResponse(updated);
```

The mapper handles complex nested objects like contact information and addresses, with special logic for copying physical addresses to mailing addresses when they're marked as the same. The `organizationId` field is immutable after creation and automatically generated as a UUID.
