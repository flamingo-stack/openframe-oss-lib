<!-- source-hash: 5abb8ee78668d4cf3947703d4b267f9b -->
A Spring component that provides bidirectional mapping between organization DTOs and entities, supporting both GraphQL and REST API operations with automatic UUID generation and partial updates.

## Key Components

- **`toEntity(CreateOrganizationRequest)`** - Converts create requests to Organization entities with auto-generated UUID
- **`updateEntity(Organization, UpdateOrganizationRequest)`** - Performs partial updates on existing entities (null fields ignored)
- **`toResponse(Organization)`** - Converts entities to response DTOs
- **Contact Information Mappers** - Handles nested ContactInformation, ContactPerson, and Address mappings
- **`copyAddress(Address)`** - Creates address copies when mailing address matches physical address

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private OrganizationMapper mapper;

// Create new organization
CreateOrganizationRequest request = new CreateOrganizationRequest(...);
Organization entity = mapper.toEntity(request);

// Partial update existing organization
UpdateOrganizationRequest updateRequest = new UpdateOrganizationRequest(...);
Organization updated = mapper.updateEntity(existingOrg, updateRequest);

// Convert to response DTO
OrganizationResponse response = mapper.toResponse(entity);
```

The mapper automatically handles null safety, UUID generation for new organizations, and complex nested object mapping including contact information with address duplication logic.
