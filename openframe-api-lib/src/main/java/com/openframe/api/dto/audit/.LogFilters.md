<!-- source-hash: 35afdb52badcf6d989c31374ba97bc92 -->
A data transfer object for filtering log entries in audit operations, containing multiple filter criteria that can be applied to log queries.

## Key Components

- **toolTypes** - List of tool types to filter by (e.g., specific application tools)
- **eventTypes** - List of event types to filter by (e.g., login, logout, data access)
- **severities** - List of severity levels to filter by (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- **organizations** - List of organization filter options using custom `OrganizationFilterOption` objects

## Usage Example

```java
// Create log filters for audit query
LogFilters filters = LogFilters.builder()
    .toolTypes(List.of("USER_MANAGEMENT", "DATA_PROCESSOR"))
    .eventTypes(List.of("LOGIN", "DATA_ACCESS", "CONFIGURATION_CHANGE"))
    .severities(List.of("WARN", "ERROR"))
    .organizations(List.of(
        OrganizationFilterOption.builder()
            .organizationId("org-123")
            .includeSubOrganizations(true)
            .build()
    ))
    .build();

// Use in audit service
auditService.getLogs(filters);
```

This class uses Lombok annotations for automatic generation of constructors, getters, setters, and builder pattern, making it ideal for building complex filter combinations in audit log queries.
