<!-- source-hash: 35afdb52badcf6d989c31374ba97bc92 -->
A data transfer object (DTO) that defines filtering criteria for audit logs, providing structured access to filter logs by tool types, event types, severities, and organizations.

## Key Components

- **toolTypes** - List of strings to filter logs by specific tool types
- **eventTypes** - List of strings to filter logs by event categories
- **severities** - List of strings to filter logs by severity levels (e.g., ERROR, WARN, INFO)
- **organizations** - List of `OrganizationFilterOption` objects for organization-based filtering

## Usage Example

```java
// Create log filters for error monitoring
LogFilters filters = LogFilters.builder()
    .toolTypes(List.of("deployment", "monitoring"))
    .eventTypes(List.of("error", "warning"))
    .severities(List.of("ERROR", "CRITICAL"))
    .organizations(List.of(
        OrganizationFilterOption.builder()
            .id("org-123")
            .name("Production Team")
            .build()
    ))
    .build();

// Use with audit service
auditService.getLogs(filters);
```

This DTO uses Lombok annotations for automatic generation of getters, setters, constructors, and builder pattern, making it easy to construct complex filter combinations for audit log queries.
