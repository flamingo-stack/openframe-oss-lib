Data Transfer Object for filtering audit log entries with support for multiple filter criteria including tool types, event types, severities, and organization-based filtering.

## Key Components

- **toolTypes** - List of tool type identifiers to filter logs by specific tools
- **eventTypes** - List of event type names to filter by specific audit events
- **severities** - List of severity levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR) for log filtering
- **organizations** - List of organization filter options for multi-tenant log access

## Usage Example

```java
// Create filters for error logs from specific tools
LogFilters filters = LogFilters.builder()
    .toolTypes(Arrays.asList("authentication", "api-gateway"))
    .eventTypes(Arrays.asList("login_failure", "api_error"))
    .severities(Arrays.asList("ERROR", "CRITICAL"))
    .organizations(Arrays.asList(
        new OrganizationFilterOption("org-123", "Company A"),
        new OrganizationFilterOption("org-456", "Company B")
    ))
    .build();

// Use with audit log service
List<AuditLog> filteredLogs = auditService.getLogs(filters);
```

The class uses Lombok annotations for automatic generation of getters, setters, constructors, and builder pattern implementation, making it easy to construct filter combinations for audit log queries.
