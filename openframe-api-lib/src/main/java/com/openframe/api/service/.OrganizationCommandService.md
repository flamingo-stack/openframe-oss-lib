Facade service that handles organization command operations (Create, Update, Delete) by converting DTOs to entities and delegating to the core OrganizationService. This service layer prevents circular dependencies by handling DTO mapping in the api-lib module.

## Key Components

- **createOrganization()** - Creates new organization from CreateOrganizationRequest DTO
- **updateOrganization()** - Performs partial updates using UpdateOrganizationRequest DTO
- **deleteOrganization()** - Deletes organization by ID with proper validation
- **OrganizationMapper** - Handles DTO to entity conversions
- **OrganizationService** - Core service dependency for data operations

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private OrganizationCommandService commandService;

// Create new organization
CreateOrganizationRequest createRequest = new CreateOrganizationRequest("Acme Corp");
Organization created = commandService.createOrganization(createRequest);

// Update existing organization
UpdateOrganizationRequest updateRequest = new UpdateOrganizationRequest("Acme Corporation");
Organization updated = commandService.updateOrganization(created.getId(), updateRequest);

// Delete organization
commandService.deleteOrganization(created.getId());
```

The service performs validation, logging, and delegates machine association checks to the underlying OrganizationService during delete operations.
