A Spring service that manages tool connections associated with machines, providing efficient batch and single machine queries for DataLoader operations.

## Key Components

- **ToolConnectionService**: Main service class with read-only transaction support
- **getToolConnectionsForMachines()**: Batch method that retrieves tool connections for multiple machines simultaneously, returning results in the same order as input machine IDs
- **getToolConnectionsForMachine()**: Single machine query method that returns tool connections for a specific machine
- **ToolConnectionRepository**: Repository dependency for database operations

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private ToolConnectionService toolConnectionService;

// Get connections for multiple machines (efficient batch operation)
List<String> machineIds = Arrays.asList("machine1", "machine2", "machine3");
List<List<ToolConnection>> connectionsByMachine = 
    toolConnectionService.getToolConnectionsForMachines(machineIds);

// Results are ordered - connectionsByMachine.get(0) contains connections for "machine1"
List<ToolConnection> machine1Connections = connectionsByMachine.get(0);

// Get connections for a single machine
List<ToolConnection> singleMachineConnections = 
    toolConnectionService.getToolConnectionsForMachine("machine1");
```

The batch method is optimized to minimize database queries by fetching all connections at once and grouping them by machine ID, making it ideal for DataLoader scenarios where multiple machines need to be processed efficiently.
