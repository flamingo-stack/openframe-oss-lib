Provides JWT issuer URLs for multi-tenant authentication by combining a configurable base URL with tenant IDs from the database. Implements thread-safe caching to avoid repeated database queries.

## Key Components

- **resolveIssuerUrls()** - Reactively fetches tenant data and constructs issuer URLs with atomic caching
- **getCachedIssuerUrl()** - Returns cached issuer URLs or triggers resolution if cache is empty
- **allowedIssuerBase** - Configurable base URL for JWT issuers
- **superTenantId** - Optional super tenant configuration for additional issuer URL

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private IssuerUrlProvider issuerUrlProvider;

// Reactive approach - get issuer URLs asynchronously
issuerUrlProvider.resolveIssuerUrls()
    .subscribe(urls -> {
        // urls contains ["https://auth.example.com/tenant1", "https://auth.example.com/super"]
        log.info("Available issuers: {}", urls);
    });

// Synchronous approach - get cached URLs
List<String> cachedUrls = issuerUrlProvider.getCachedIssuerUrl();
if (!cachedUrls.isEmpty()) {
    String primaryIssuer = cachedUrls.get(0);
    // Use for JWT validation
}
```

The component automatically handles tenant discovery, URL construction, and provides both reactive and synchronous access patterns for JWT issuer validation in multi-tenant environments.
