<!-- source-hash: da648794988be0635e56bb592d61497a -->
A Spring WebFlux filter that sanitizes HTTP Origin headers by removing them when they contain the literal string "null".

## Key Components

- **OriginSanitizerFilter** - Main filter class implementing `WebFilter` interface
- **filter()** - Core method that processes incoming requests and sanitizes Origin headers
- **@Order(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)** - Ensures this filter runs before other security filters

## Usage Example

This filter automatically processes all incoming requests in a Spring WebFlux application:

```java
// The filter runs automatically for all requests
// When a request comes with Origin: "null", it removes the header

// Before filtering:
// GET /api/data
// Origin: null

// After filtering:
// GET /api/data
// (Origin header removed)

// Normal origins pass through unchanged:
// Origin: https://example.com -> remains unchanged
```

The filter addresses security concerns where browsers or clients send the literal string "null" as an Origin value, which can cause issues with CORS validation. By removing these invalid Origin headers, downstream security filters and CORS handlers can process requests more predictably.
