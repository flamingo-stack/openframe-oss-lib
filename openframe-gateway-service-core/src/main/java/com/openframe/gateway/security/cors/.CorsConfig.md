This configuration class sets up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for a Spring Cloud Gateway application, providing conditional CORS filtering based on application properties.

## Key Components

- **CorsConfig** - Main configuration class that conditionally enables CORS support
- **corsConfiguration()** - Bean method that creates a CORS configuration bound to Spring properties
- **corsWebFilter()** - Bean method that creates a reactive CORS web filter for all routes
- **@ConditionalOnProperty** - Enables CORS only when `openframe.gateway.disable-cors` is false or missing

## Usage Example

Configure CORS settings in your `application.yml`:

```java
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      globalcors:
        cors-configurations:
          '[/**]':
            allowed-origins: "https://example.com"
            allowed-methods: 
              - GET
              - POST
              - PUT
              - DELETE
            allowed-headers: "*"
            allow-credentials: true

# Optionally disable CORS entirely
openframe:
  gateway:
    disable-cors: false
```

The configuration automatically applies to all routes (`/**`) and uses Spring's reactive CORS filtering mechanism. CORS can be completely disabled by setting `openframe.gateway.disable-cors=true` in your properties.
