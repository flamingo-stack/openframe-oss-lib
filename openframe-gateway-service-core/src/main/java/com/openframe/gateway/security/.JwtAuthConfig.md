Configuration class that sets up JWT authentication with caching and multi-issuer support for reactive Spring Security applications. It creates cached authentication managers for different JWT issuers and provides strict issuer validation.

## Key Components

- **issuerManagersCache()** - Creates a Caffeine cache storing `ReactiveAuthenticationManager` instances by issuer URL
- **jwtIssuerAuthenticationManagerResolver()** - Resolves authentication managers based on JWT issuer claims
- **createStrictIssuerValidator()** - Custom validator that ensures JWT issuers are in the allowed list
- **Cache configuration** - Properties for cache size, expiration, and refresh timing

## Usage Example

```java
@Component
public class SecurityConfig {
    
    @Autowired
    private JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver resolver;
    
    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain filterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
        return http
            .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2
                .authenticationManagerResolver(resolver)
            )
            .build();
    }
}

// Configuration properties
# application.yml
openframe:
  security:
    jwt:
      cache:
        expire-after: PT1H
        refresh-after: PT30M
        maximum-size: 1000
```

The cache improves performance by storing JWT decoders and validators, avoiding repeated JWKS endpoint calls for the same issuers while maintaining security through strict issuer validation.
