Configuration class that sets up JWT authentication with multi-tenant support, caching JWT decoders and authentication managers for different issuers to optimize performance in gateway scenarios.

## Key Components

**LoadingCache Bean (`issuerManagersCache`)**
- Caffeine cache storing `ReactiveAuthenticationManager` instances by issuer
- Configurable expiration, refresh, and size limits
- Handles both internal JWT config and external issuer discovery

**JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver Bean**
- Routes JWT authentication requests to appropriate managers based on issuer
- Integrates with the issuer managers cache for efficient lookup

**Strict Issuer Validator (`createStrictIssuerValidator`)**
- Custom JWT validator that checks issuer against allowed tenant URLs
- Provides additional security layer beyond default Spring validation

## Usage Example

```java
@Component
public class SecurityService {
    
    @Autowired
    private JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver resolver;
    
    public Mono<Authentication> authenticateJwt(String token) {
        // Extract issuer from JWT and resolve appropriate manager
        return resolver.resolve(extractIssuer(token))
            .flatMap(manager -> manager.authenticate(jwtAuthToken));
    }
}
```

The configuration automatically handles JWT validation for multiple tenants, caching authentication managers to avoid repeated expensive operations like public key retrieval and decoder setup.
