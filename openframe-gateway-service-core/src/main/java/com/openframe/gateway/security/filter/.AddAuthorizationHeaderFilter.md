A Spring WebFlux filter that resolves bearer tokens from multiple sources (cookies, custom headers, query parameters) and adds them to the Authorization header for downstream resource server authentication.

## Key Components

- **WebFilter Implementation**: Core reactive filter that processes requests before authentication
- **Multi-source Token Resolution**: Extracts bearer tokens from cookies, Access-Token header, or authorization query parameter
- **Path-based Filtering**: Only processes private paths that require authentication
- **Authorization Header Injection**: Adds "Bearer {token}" header when missing but token is available

## Usage Example

The filter automatically processes requests and resolves tokens in this priority order:

```java
// 1. From access_token cookie (highest priority)
Cookie: access_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

// 2. From Access-Token custom header
Access-Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

// 3. From authorization query parameter (lowest priority)
GET /dashboard/users?authorization=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

// Resulting request will have:
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

Private paths requiring authentication include:
- `/dashboard/**` - Dashboard endpoints
- `/tools/**` - Tool service endpoints  
- `/ws-tools/**` - WebSocket tool endpoints
- `/chat/**` - Chat service endpoints
- `/clients/**` (with specific exclusions for metrics, registration, OAuth, and tool-agent endpoints)
