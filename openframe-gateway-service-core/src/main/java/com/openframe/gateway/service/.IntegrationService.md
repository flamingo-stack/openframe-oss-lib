Service responsible for managing and testing connections to integrated external tools within the OpenFrame gateway.

## Key Components

- **`testIntegrationConnection(String toolId)`** - Tests connectivity to an integrated tool by making a health check request
- **`adjustUrl(String originalUrl)`** - Modifies URLs for local development by replacing hostnames with localhost
- **`isLocalProfile()`** - Determines if the application is running in local development mode

**Dependencies:**
- `ToolUrlService` - Manages tool URL configurations
- `ReactiveIntegratedToolRepository` - Repository for integrated tool data
- `WebClient.Builder` - For making HTTP requests to external services

## Usage Example

```java
@Autowired
private IntegrationService integrationService;

// Test connection to an integrated tool
integrationService.testIntegrationConnection("tool-123")
    .subscribe(
        response -> log.info("Connection test successful: {}", response),
        error -> log.error("Connection test failed", error)
    );

// The service automatically adjusts URLs for local development
// Production URL: https://external-service.com/api
// Local URL: http://localhost:8080/api (when running with 'local' profile)
```

The service validates that tools are enabled before testing connections and automatically appends `/health` to the tool's API URL for health checks. URL adjustment ensures seamless local development by redirecting external service calls to localhost.
