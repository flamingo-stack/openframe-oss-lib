A Netty channel handler that logs outgoing HTTP requests as curl commands for debugging and monitoring purposes in the OpenFrame gateway.

## Key Components

- **CurlLoggingHandler** - Main class extending `ChannelDuplexHandler` to intercept HTTP requests
- **TARGET_URI** - Static attribute key for storing the target URI in channel attributes
- **curl** - StringBuilder for building the curl command representation
- **channelRegistered()** - Logs channel registration events
- **write()** - Intercepts outgoing HTTP requests and converts them to curl format

## Usage Example

```java
// Add to Netty pipeline for request logging
ChannelPipeline pipeline = channel.pipeline();
pipeline.addLast("curlLogger", new CurlLoggingHandler());

// Set target URI in channel attributes
URI targetUri = URI.create("https://api.example.com/endpoint");
channel.attr(CurlLoggingHandler.TARGET_URI).set(targetUri);

// HTTP requests through this channel will be logged as curl commands
```

The handler captures HTTP method, URL, headers (excluding Host), and request body to generate equivalent curl commands. It uses the target URI from channel attributes when available, falling back to the request URI. The generated curl command is logged when the complete request (including `LastHttpContent`) is processed, making it useful for debugging API calls and reproducing requests manually.
