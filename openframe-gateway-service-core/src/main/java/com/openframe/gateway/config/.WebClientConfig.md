Spring configuration class that creates a customized WebClient builder with comprehensive timeout settings for HTTP client connections.

## Key Components

- **`webClientBuilder()`** - Bean method that creates a WebClient.Builder with configured timeouts
- **HttpClient configuration** - Sets up connection, read, write, and response timeouts (all 30 seconds)
- **ReactorClientHttpConnector** - Integrates the configured Netty HttpClient with Spring's WebClient

## Usage Example

```java
@Service
public class ExternalApiService {
    
    private final WebClient webClient;
    
    public ExternalApiService(WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder) {
        this.webClient = webClientBuilder
            .baseUrl("https://api.example.com")
            .build();
    }
    
    public Mono<String> fetchData() {
        return webClient.get()
            .uri("/data")
            .retrieve()
            .bodyToMono(String.class);
    }
}
```

The configuration ensures all HTTP operations have consistent 30-second timeouts for connection establishment, read operations, write operations, and overall response time. This prevents hanging requests and provides predictable behavior for downstream services consuming the WebClient.
