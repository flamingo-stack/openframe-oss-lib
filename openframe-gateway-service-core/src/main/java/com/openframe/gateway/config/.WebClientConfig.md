Configuration class that sets up a customized WebClient builder with timeout settings for HTTP client connections in a Spring reactive application.

## Key Components

- **`webClientBuilder()`** - Bean method that creates a configured WebClient.Builder with custom timeout settings
- **HttpClient configuration** - Netty-based HTTP client with connection, response, read, and write timeouts all set to 30 seconds
- **ReactorClientHttpConnector** - Connector that integrates the configured HttpClient with Spring's WebClient

## Usage Example

```java
@Service
public class ExternalApiService {
    
    private final WebClient webClient;
    
    public ExternalApiService(WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder) {
        this.webClient = webClientBuilder
            .baseUrl("https://api.example.com")
            .build();
    }
    
    public Mono<String> fetchData() {
        return webClient.get()
            .uri("/data")
            .retrieve()
            .bodyToMono(String.class);
    }
}
```

The configuration ensures all HTTP operations have consistent 30-second timeouts for connection establishment, response waiting, and read/write operations, providing reliable timeout behavior for downstream service calls.
