Enumeration defining the two types of authenticated actors in the OpenFrame security system, distinguishing between human administrators and automated agent machines.

## Key Components

- **ADMIN** - Represents admin users with full access rights to the system
- **AGENT** - Represents agent machines with limited, programmatic access rights

## Usage Example

```java
// Determine access level based on actor type
public boolean hasFullAccess(ActorType actorType) {
    return actorType == ActorType.ADMIN;
}

// Usage in authentication context
public void authenticateActor(String principal, ActorType type) {
    switch (type) {
        case ADMIN:
            grantFullSystemAccess(principal);
            break;
        case AGENT:
            grantLimitedMachineAccess(principal);
            break;
    }
}

// Check permissions before sensitive operations
if (currentActor.getType() == ActorType.ADMIN) {
    performAdminOperation();
} else {
    performAgentOperation();
}
```

This enum is typically used in conjunction with authentication tokens and security contexts to enforce role-based access control throughout the OpenFrame system.
